","I opened my door and screamed for an ambulance. I ran back into the kitchen and grabbed my last bag to throw out all my food. We had been running from people like us but I never wanted to die without one more adventure under my belt before I did so.

When they came over I begged them not to hurt me. They said they would only give me 10 minutes but that it would be pointless because no matter what we all were going to die anyway. When the police arrived they heard our pleas and put cuffs on me and shot me with a tranquilizer. The ambulance got there as fast as humanly possible after that and took me back home. In my bedroom now I have my wife looking over me while crying and holding onto me as if my death is the biggest thing since the collapse of Rome. She wants to ask me why this happened, when I knew how it was going to happen; she is just very emotional at the moment.

","The last few years had been rough on me. I’d been travelling the world for several months when my travels got bad-ass enough for someone to send an order for pizza. This has been so normal now that I don’t even think about it anymore and just assume the delivery boy is going to show up with my food by late-morning as usual

When he did show up this morning something was off though: The young delivery guy wasn’t wearing his uniform. As he walked into my apartment building I noticed the pizza box in his hand and he seemed out-of-breath, like he had just ran a mile without stopping (he did only have one other foot) “Where’s your name tag?” I asked him breathlessly “I lost it” He said through gasps “What!” I yelled “What happened! Did one of those aliens finally return?! Did they kidnap your whole family?!” When he saw me coming towards him faster than ever before he put his hands up “Oh hey hey sorry no harm done! One moment please...”

The second he opened the doors for me inside he dropped my pizza but right after seeing our eyes meet again, I caught the pizza in midair “Whoa good catch buddy, nice shoes”

As I started unboxing my pizza all the familiar boxes that went missing came back. My new home-boy PizzaDude told me “Dude I am not a dude, what kind of human names themselves Dude?!” “Um...” Well... yeah there is no better way of naming yourself when you are 19 and half Italian than PizzaDude. What else would you be?!

""You're telling me you didn't recognise me?"" ""No!"" ""Well aren't you funny."" *laughs* ""What exactly am I supposed to know! You come barging in here, wearing pajamas, breathing heavy, carrying around an object called a 'pizza'. That doesn't exactly scream 'delivery dude' does it! So tell me, who are you anyway?"" ""Well.... actually..."" ""Yes?"" ""Wait, wait, wait, hold your horses buddy! Give him a minute ok?!?!?!? Oh wow, wow, wow!!! Now isn't that a great idea?"" *eyes look left to right while slowly raising eyebrows.* ""Wow, well this sure is weird! Hey man we could try working at another place together, or...."" ""Woah woah woah woah whoa!!!"" ""Yeah, yeah, chill dude! I got this! Ok, so how about pizza, and then more pizza, like every single day!!!""
""Hey, guys remember when I told you that the universe hated me and I would die alone. Remember."" ""How could we not remember that!"" ""Now look at you two!"" ""That pizza,"" one says. ""Was the universe trying to warn us of your death?!"" ""It wanted to kill us both?!"" ""So much worse,"" ""So much worse...!"" ""So much worse,"" ""SO MUCH WORSE!!!"" ""We have a debt to settle"", ""WITH THE UNIVERSE!!!"" ""WE HAVE A DEBT TO SETTLE!"" ""THAT MEANS DEATH!!!""""DEATH!!""

","""I'll never find it,"" I whispered, closing my eyes as I sank onto the dusty, worn-out sofa.

The last twenty years had felt like this, not really having *anything* happened. Life at home wasn't horrible, but neither was it enjoyable for me. Every night I'd wake up at the same time, after being completely unrested thanks to nightmares that always kept coming back, even if I tried to forget them. 

What made them worse were the endless trips through the black void of space where I got forced into countless battles. Each one ended with all the other people from the world I lived in getting wiped out. In a way, these trips didn't matter. There weren't any real consequences, except for how much more dangerous they made every single day when the dreams came back.

This place made it worse because there was no clear escape, no exit wounds. If I closed my eyes here I knew that I'd wake up in the dream again. If I opened my eyes here I'd see what stood in front of me; a horde of evil beings ready to attack the people around me, waiting for their next chance to wipe the entire human race off of existence.

If someone asked ""what is the point?"" well, this is exactly the kind of situation I was trapped in: no hope, no future, just forever. And all of my friends would be right where I am now whenever I wake up, ready to get attacked by something I couldn't see or avoid unless I fell asleep again and woke up in another adventure. But maybe tomorrow, or the day after, a door would open on the far side of the couch, taking me to the next dimension and ending my plight. Maybe.

","""What are you talking about?"" I said. 

The old man stared at me with sadness behind his eyes. ""What's it supposed to be now, son?"" 

We were both sitting on the edge of a massive well, listening to the roar of water churning below us. 

""It's not going anywhere,"" the old man said as he looked ahead across the ocean. 

I frowned. ""No, but... how is that even possible?!"" 

""Oh boy."" He coughed and started breathing heavily, struggling under the force of the wind whipping from the sea before turning back towards me. ""You guys just didn't listen did ya? You couldn't tell me anything until this happened. Well guess what's up."" The old man took another deep breath, then collapsed down beside me onto the cliff's edge.  

I had been sent by my father to save the world from a great and unimaginable evil known only as the Destroyer Of Worlds, also known as Eggman. Apparently when a great warrior defeats him each time, he comes back stronger than before. In fact it wasn't an Eggman at all! When people heard the name they began to think the legendary super-villain Robotnik was back, but it wasn't. It's actually worse than they ever thought. This bad guy was actually much more dangerous than anyone predicted, especially when I found out who he actually was. 

""Wait a minute, isn't Eggman-"" I shouted while pointing backwards toward where I came from. 

The old man laughed, holding tightly to his knees so he wouldn't fall over. ""Yes. Don't you understand? We never went after him when we first met. Why do you think Eggman would go away if we tried fighting him for the ten years he was free? That's why every one of us fell. They died because they wanted it. None knew better what this world was going through. Just like all warriors before you, you didn't learn the true meaning of the chicken and the egg. But unlike them..."" He reached his hand forward and pressed against mine. ""...you still have your strength, or rather... your weakness.""

","I'm really an actor, playing the role of a psychic and I do it on stage. Tonight is different, though. There is no imaginary audience cheering for me as I walk onstage but there are cameras trained on my face, ready to record every expression I make. This night was also very special, tonight being my mother-in-law, who died when she was born. As I looked into the camera, I see images of my family from that year flash across.

It was strange seeing them all again and yet I had no control over my thoughts at this point. A name came to mind with every image and then they seemed like random pictures, like flashes of light crossing my vision, until I realized what happened. The one thing that kept replaying over and over in my head was a name of someone who I did not know - John Killian. Was he connected somehow to my wife? What was his significance? Why did he always seem to appear in these visions with everything else?

His wife was ill, and only with her grandfather's help would he be able to learn what his grandfather wanted him to do so that she would recover.

He walked inside, closed the door, and pulled out a folded piece of paper from his pocket containing an address written on it, then sat down opposite the table covered with beads and crystal balls. 

The woman in front of him looked at him. ""What brings you here?""

","My eyes are wide open but my brain is shut off while I stare at his hand in front of me as it gestures at him with an empty white sheet on top. This guy has nothing left inside of him! It is no surprise that he is now paralyzed from the waste down. You would think this would be a great opportunity for me, considering there are more paralytics than any other type of criminal these days so you see a lot less of them.  

For this guy however, there is something worse than paralytic damage. He was caught last week, right before leaving the city, in possession of 20 bags of heroin. The dealer was apprehended, however the police have never been able to recover all the narcotics as well as they had initially planned since the dope itself was cut to hell and back with every one of the 15kg packets still being sold for profit. The dealers managed to dump most of the stuff in dumpsters and alleyways that were then stolen and tossed into a pile next to Highway 68 near El Dorado where it had been recovered by local cops over three months ago. These poor sods didn't even know what they were dealing with half the times they dealt or smoked their product! It got people hooked pretty bad though. That's why I got the job with the man sitting across from me instead of someone who could help him move around.  I wonder if his family is gonna sell him out just because? Yeah maybe. No wait... they usually do but this is different. What's different about this time is that my ability is finally working as I normally am supposed to do. As long as it doesn't work more than once, I will always get paid and leave money for a new bottle of water on my desk too. After all these years with no luck, the only thing stopping me from quitting was getting to drink free alcohol. In fact, after last month when I went on a break and found myself standing in line at Kwik-E-Mart with two liters of Mountain Dew and a liter of Ice Tea and some Cheetos and popcorn watching my favourite football team win their playoff game without having to pay for any of it, I knew it was time.  I couldn't afford to quit at the end of this month either so I picked up this case instead. But yeah....that may not be the right word for it.  

He is crying softly now and says that he has come down here to talk to his dad who passed away about twenty fucking minutes ago! Jesus Christ!!! Why wouldn't this shit work properly?! All I wanted was a couple months of decent fun with free liquor!  There are some things in life that we can't predict and sure as hell aren't normal parts of our everyday existence.

""As a *genuine* psychic, I would say they're having a blast! Especially Momma! She's enjoying all of this new-fangled ""therapy"" and ""meditation,"" haha,"" said Dr. Michael Scott laughing, as he watched his favorite sitcom on TV, while relaxing by a hot spring with the sounds of crashing waves all around him.

With no one present but the two of them, and Dr. Scott's wife, Pam wasn't watching tv and had left her office for the day already, Jan brought out another notepad from inside his purse and jotted something down before returning it back to himself. He began writing when someone knocked on the door. The Doctor opened it up to find Darryl walking behind it holding a bowl that looked like the plastic ones used at kids birthday parties. 

When Darryl entered, he took off his glasses. As if remembering something important, he walked toward a bookshelf located next to the television. After taking a few moments to look at various books he picked one open revealing a yellowed image underneath its protective cover: an article about the infamous psychic fraud known as ""John Von Tesch"". While reading over the article Darryl noticed a single sentence on page one that caught his eye: *""Psychic abilities were not detected.""*

Darryl grabbed the paper and exited through the door after giving the doctor a slight nod and a smile saying nothing before getting into his car. As the light turned red, he drove back home pondering why the doctor would use this as part of their charade.

""Hey! Don't touch my stuff!"" A hand snatched away an ice cream cone. You ran after him. After all it had chocolate dripping down his chin. He dodged past everyone. The chase wasn't easy. When they stopped he grabbed for more cones. Another chase started -this time however, his group made fun of you by yelling things like ""Ice Scream Go"" or whatever other ridiculous shit they came up with. They laughed as you chased them through the train station and out into the streets. As a final trick they threw popcorn out the windows, so now you were covered in it too, while you still weren't tired! This would come back to haunt them later in life.

I once got hit by a hot dog flying through the air as two kids tried to prank each other. It was hard not to laugh.


That's enough about those idiots. In my quest I didn't stop until the last person stood before me. They looked like a little kid who wore adult clothes because their mom forced them. They had huge round glasses that could barely hide his swollen red ears. There was only one way to end this. I said calmly ""Well well... what have we here?"" Then I punched his nose. A light sound and then silence followed, which quickly turned into a bunch of coughs and sneezes as they gagged uncontrollably. His face went pale and he started stammering. Finally, with shaky words he responded: ""N..no, I... I can't believe you actually did it, hahahaa, hhahahahahaha!!!!"" That was the moment of truth. I knew for sure then that he must be mentally unstable, otherwise how else would he continue laughing in response to such simple actions. Now being exhausted, drenched in sticky sweet food, I decided to leave. ""You can take everything you want,"" I said calmly, and walked away leaving no one but the lone child alone on the street. 



Later on that day I bought ice cream again from a local vendor.

She's dressed to impress, but it's so obvious she can't find her pen because someone has probably stolen it or is planning to pickpocket it right now...she looks at the station sign and seems to be lost, wondering if anyone would like to join her before getting up to go find out what time it is.

Someone bumps into my leg and I look around for whom it was until the sound of 'the man who killed Jack Reacher's dad made its way across the train car towards me. He looked exactly like the description from the paper they ran earlier this week: young white man with a messy black afro, black shirt, light blue jeans, black sneakers and carrying the distinctive looking laptop bag that some asshole stole. As he got closer and closer and his presence grew larger, I thought about calling him out. This guy clearly does not belong here, especially if his agenda is trying to steal your pen. 

""Hey,"" he said smiling ""You know we don't want your cell phone anymore?""

I laughed ""No no no...""

""See, everyone else just drops their phones when they see us walk by.""

He had already moved closer now, close enough to smell the sweat stains on his hands

""What are you talking about?""

""Your phone!"" He grabbed it and tossed it back onto my table and grinned mischievously ""It was pretty much on vibrate anyway""

I gave him a hard stare

He raised his eyebrows innocently and shrugged

I got up ""Where do you live?""

""Oh hey! You have my number? Where is the station where you dropped my tablet?""""

He put down his headphones then looked directly at me.

The words were coming out very slowly. ""Copenhagen. Denmark""

My head whipped around, eyes searching for anything out of place, before I saw a long piece of tape in his hand: The red ribbon that belonged to me. I gave him my number before thanking him for finding it and walked home, a little embarrassed yet relieved. It had been too windy lately; if I got caught again, my ears would be full of snow.

","The last time I met someone at the hospital, it was because they called an ambulance when I tripped on my way to go for a walk. The person had heard me fall into the sidewalk and called paramedics...

I'm not sure how many times I failed to save myself from this sort of accident...

Anyway, after stumbling a couple of feet forward before hitting my hand down on soft wet grass (and breaking my nose), the paramedics showed up. Someone yelled for help, some guy got his face close enough to hear me scream as he tried to help, and someone in an orange shirt told everyone what had been happening. No one did anything but watch the bleeding while I stood there frozen trying to figure out what to do about my injured nose.

The paramedics said I might need plastic surgery to fix it. That sucked. My insurance ran out of money just two months ago, so paying cash was beyond my budget. If someone else called an ambulance then maybe I wouldn't be like this right now...

Luckily, there is always another adventure awaiting. This night I made something that sounded like ""meow"". It got a lot of looks until the next idiot decided to call for an ambulance when they saw a black cat running across the street and got knocked over by it. Not their fault though; they weren't looking where they were going...or listening!

Just wait, this could get good...

""So, can you tell us why we should let you live?""

""Why?"" I asked back with innocent eyes. ""No one has ever noticed me doing anything other than staring blankly ahead all day!""

""What do you mean 'stare blankly ahead? You look really smart though.""

As soon as I spoke the three men began to run toward me. They looked more like robots from science fiction than the walking, talking creatures they pretended to be.

Their screams echoed off the buildings lining their square, even more loudly than my fist had connected with bone. Then it struck me: I should have seen this coming. As their fear escalated the adrenaline pumping through my veins became louder. Now I was seeing their panic, understanding of their terror. To add insult to injury, their faces turned pale and contorted with confusion. My head started spinning and the lights began to flicker.

My heart is beating faster now, not from fear (incase you were wondering why), but because they're here.

Well three of them... The first to arrive was some guy with red hair, he had this big black belt hanging around his waist with little golden circles on them. He looked like some kind of karate master - no offense Mr. Karate Man, or whatever your name might be. After him came two kids, a girl and boy. They both looked scared! One had messy brown hair, almost black at the point, probably around 14. The other one had blonde braids pulled up into a ponytail, somewhere around ages 9-10 maybe? They weren't exactly intimidating, those kids! Lastly, there was a huge muscular man with a green skull mask and dark grey spandex costume. You must be thinking that I am joking, since I am a giant yellow-skinned octopus wearing a tuxedo holding several thousand dollars worth of loot as hostage.

Instead of grabbing my money bag which was sitting right there next to a plastic box full of cookies, they pointed their pistols at each other, guns blazing... Oh shit! This wasn't part of our plan. Then suddenly, it hit me: It was probably these heroics in training! I mean, come on, how do we expect a good hero to start out like that? Just pointing their gun in the air without aiming? Or worse, doing that weird thing where you shake the weapon to get everyone to trust you and then try to shoot it off when nobody looks the other way. Ugh.... If only they would learn. But fine, this will work too! No time to waste anyway. They decided to hold guns to their chests and act very threateningly - but oh god those awkward poses really are making it hard. Especially this one dumb kid shooting air at everybody else, instead of trying to shoot me! I decide to help the kids by showing them how to correctly aim. First things first, they need to know where the bullet would go if they shot at me, so I gave them simple instructions. ""Try aiming straight ahead, let the bullet travel forward..."" Suddenly, the blond kid stops smiling, and starts crying, but I think it's happy tears, cause he looks kinda excited actually. I guess he finally understood. I taught him how to hold the pistol properly, and after a moment of silence, he starts laughing. Great! Now the blue haired dude needs to know how to shoot. It's the hardest skill to master, it's really hard to be patient and aim towards the center of your target when you see somebody pointing a gun in your chest! I told him to focus and calm down a bit before starting to shoot. But as usual, he doesn't seem like he heard a word of what I said. I knew I had failed yet again, once again these idiots thought it was a movie and tried to act like Indiana Jones or something. But wait, no, NOOOO!! Don't tell me that one did a magic trick with the bullets either, great job dummy... ""Now what?"" Well... the answer was easy.

The blond girl giggled as she tapped on them. ""Uh huh,"" she answered each of them.

""...what will happen if you lose?"" The hero in browns said, trying to sound more serious.

She grinned. ""Well,"" She smiled wider than usual, ""The last person who laughs wins! If I win...I'll finally bring back the '90s!"" Her fingers reached up to make a dramatic gesture, her hair flew around her face. 

After making some faces in response, they turned the box toward each other. Some time had passed since the blonde came forward. Now they were looking away. They didn't notice that it was dark. 

It must have been too long ago.

*They turn around.*

""Wait!"" A blue blur ran over and tried to grab the lunchbox from the blonde's hands but failed miserably when she kicked him. As much strength as he could muster wasn't nearly enough to stop her. He fell down flat on his back as the blonde continued laughing and the other hero jumped on board. There must be hundreds of boxes in the room. *Her laughter only stopped after he tripped into one of them.* 

Another hundred and three boxes remained unplayed of and filled with food. It seemed like they both lost track of how many there were until just after thirty-two of them were opened. Every pair of eyes stared up at the ceiling. Their mouths gaped wide open as they struggled to find words as she took an orange slice off of another box without opening it before taking another bite and asking, *""What's your name?""* She smiled once again as she waited. None of them spoke for what felt like minutes before the yellow hero suddenly broke the silence. He sat himself next to the blue one. And soon after, the brown and red ones joined them. After several tense moments, the black and white hero stepped forward. His grin spread across his face and a glint appeared in his eye.

""I hate those lunches,"" he shouted as he swung a fist towards the blonde girl who laughed despite his attack. Soon, all of them did the same thing in unison. The blonde sighed but managed to kick the yellow, red, green, and brown guys over so that she was able to run away. She was halfway away by the time the rest of them caught up but they weren't far behind because it would not have been possible for the speedster to escape from them alone. Despite running with her head tucked between her legs and clutching a small bag around her torso tightly in order to prevent losing the few precious objects she had remaining, she knew that they wouldn't catch her any time soon. Not unless they were teleportation masters which she doubted due to only three being able to keep up so far.

*Suddenly she stopped mid stride.*

","The old man shook his head and patted my shoulder. ""You got 10 minutes, kid. I don't know why they give criminals time like this.""

As if on cue a group of armed men marched inside with guns drawn, laughing at the sight of their captured victim in handcuffs behind bars.  I did not panic I took my new gun out and fired into the air as quickly as I could but nobody returned fire I knew that it was useless so I continued firing until all nine shots had gone off; then with one final shot I put the gun into the back of my skull. It hit and went black. My eyes flew open and i realized there wasn't much left... only the small piece sticking out and a few brain waves hitting some wires around me. They couldn't have gotten away with this.  I thought to myself.

""So..."" said the officer who cuffed me a minute ago. ""I am going to make you an offer we can do both sides happy.""  I did not respond I looked over to the door and saw through a hole in the wall how I still had access to a shotgun in front of me. Then I made the decision. With the swift motion needed for a suicide I stood up grabbed the shotgun and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed in less than half a second and went silent. ""Damn shit!"" The officer cried. The next thing I felt was nothing. The end


A cop comes running toward the metal room. He looks right down his barrel and sees his reflection. The gun is almost entirely empty. ""Shit son...."" he says before falling to the ground dead. He looks up to see the shooter walk slowly past him and out the door.....

While walking down to the bathroom the guard turns on the water with a tap when suddenly two more cops appear from nowhere and shoot him full of bullets. His body falls lifelessly to the floor in slow motion.  He glances to the side and sees nothing. This was when he notices the shower curtain has been ripped from its rack and someone has taken it, holding it in the moonlight. A single bullet is visible where it entered and another exits the ceiling above the shower. *Bang*. And the world goes black.




These stories usually happen with characters that committed an act on behalf of themself or because of them; however you won't catch these bastards doing something nice for themselves either; they never even let their victims live happily ever after without having been killed by some form of murder - even self- inflicted sometimes. Their are many kinds of stories but none can be explained. Why would someone murder another for committing a crime and also for putting police officers' jobs at risk? The answer is no one knows.

“How many more years?” 

“We don’t know.”

“Who did it?!” I demanded. “That doesn’t make any sense! My wife is gone, and now YOU’RE going too!”

“No, they don’t tell us either why.”

It was so fucking unfair. All I had been doing since graduating uni was trying to be a detective after my wife, her job took her away from me to India, where she died a horrible death just as quickly. That’s when people started coming for me—they called the police on me, thought I’d murdered her because of my career choice. Luckily we had the DNA evidence showing no relation but I was still forced into an early retirement, which killed off all our hopes and dreams for starting a family. And now here I was: ready to spend the rest of eternity in jail? For something I hadn’t done.

","The police showed me my record. I stared at it in disgust. They couldn’t prove that I ever killed someone, but as their first attempt of trying to prove I did they tried to bring up a homicide rate among residents 51 blocks north of where I lived from.  They didn’t have any idea what was going on there so they went back and forth all over until it turned out that one house had 3 deaths within 2 years for various reasons like accidents, suicide and elder abuse. They decided to prosecute because they said “it’s just a coincidence”. I got charged with murder and put in prison before trial even began. It wasn’t really justice though, more like revenge, which is funny since I killed anyone who murdered someone else. I only got out after my defense lawyer pulled up data showing the number of people murdered by those whom I killed while I was locked up was exactly equal to the murders I committed when I was free. The judge had already prejudged me to be guilty before I came to court, so he found me not guilty no matter the truth or evidence that could have been presented. That still wasn’t fair considering he also gave me the sentence to kill more people instead of just saying it again since they refused to follow legal protocol.

","I wasn't surprised. 3rd on the list with an 89.6% probability of becoming a murderer made by our genetic and bio-surveillance monitoring programs; I was even more unsurprised that I hadn't actually committed it in years as the most recent ""crime"" is now over 10 years old so the stats are quite outdated!

However, it didn't seem like it would stop there at my arrest. The world isn't really safe after all these advancements, though one should have expected nothing better from the governments that decided to put our genes and DNA up for public viewing in exchange for a good life expectancy in our youth...the laws aren't quite as bad anymore than what they've been before though.

I am currently staring down the barrel of 25 years, sentenced to prison while they make me pay for my past crimes through forced labor during what will be the remainder of my life. But who am I kidding? We already knew about the laws. Murder is just the next step in a long line of things we were told we'd never be able to do or own because our society has moved beyond moral restraints. The problem is nobody wanted to face us without any consequence if they did try anything like it.

The reason our laws got stricter was because not only did gene editors edit out many undesirable traits but also some highly sensitive aspects of behavior including emotions, ethics, morals and religious beliefs. This has led us down the path towards becoming more emotionless machines that can produce goods instead of human beings who want to enjoy life instead of living on fear of punishment. Now we have laws that say how little we can know each other when we choose and where we can live, and the rest follows suit. Most people don't remember the time before our government took away free speech, freedom of assembly, protection against unreasonable searches, etc. but we must have kept some fragments somewhere; especially given that they tried to erase those emotions. As far back as the information allows them to reach, the police came up with their verdict. Not exactly surprising to see your biggest enemy and former comrades on trial for such a huge crime.

","I awoke in the void, staring at nothing. Except for me... or something like me. I don't really know when i became aware. I just was a human who had been put inside an egg, laid on this cold white surface which could only be felt but not seen by me while lying upon it. One of its sides started pulsing as a series of sounds were made in my ear, seemingly coming out of my head, then suddenly stopped. As quickly as it began the sound ceased before a blue wave of energy entered my mouth, covering all senses. All went blurry as if swimming through ice water, making me feel heavy to the bone.

When things cleared, I looked straight ahead to see myself floating near a glowing orb. The room appeared graying away around me but kept moving faster until I reached black, yet everything continued to float, making me spin back into whiteness. Looking beyond, I saw countless humans floating about similar to me; some with eyes open wide in fear, others closing their eyes tightly in confusion, most staring with mouths gaping open. This room filled the same way mine did; with more people floating further ahead than behind and before me while the floor stayed still; I was frozen in one place without movement. A voice called to me and repeated itself several times over and over again. It started fast but slowed as the room moved past me. Then finally calmed down to barely audible whispers as I floated ever onward until I could no longer hear them anymore. From what it spoke of, they wanted me to follow and keep going forward as the room continued accelerating, reaching maximum speed and entering through a thick portal ahead and towards my new home. Some screamed from fright, some wept for despair, the majority remained silent waiting for death, perhaps because they were already dead, though never truly knowing how this came to pass. Their forms shimmered through this thin, opaque barrier as our worlds collided. Though they knew where we were now they still sought salvation and guidance of God to reach their respective paradise or hell after dying. They wished for answers as the room accelerated further still and carried us along until it finally crashed into space, ending our flight in stillness again. We emerged onto the ground as the last echo faded off, and as if nothing happened here in reality. As long as there weren't any other lights shining ahead we knew we could remain asleep and travel wherever it may take us without fear or worry, though we would never arrive anywhere unless someone took us there. When they finally arrived at their destination - Heaven or Hell - we would be delivered at once to another location via whatever form God deemed appropriate and continued to go wherever He decided would suit Him best. Perhaps this might explain why they all seemed peaceful when they died, though I couldn't help but wonder why everyone would rather suffer together in hell than alone in heaven. Yet I could never know as long as I slept within our little egg, and when I woke up I wasn't aware of any other realities yet.

I opened my eyes to a bright white box. It looked exactly like the one I'd slept inside for 200 years. The first hundred or so went fine; my mind wasn't prepared to actually die though. But then there was another test. And then another. The next I could remember, however, was walking into what sounded like a museum filled with people who were all staring right back at me and smiling. They spoke to me as if they didn't know me, but their teeth looked familiar. I sat down by myself on a cold marble floor and began to cry when I realized what happened to them all.

In my world, they gave me all the best parts of an android (because AI can simulate emotions just fine). Then they started putting them in prisons with no memory of their existence. They did something else, too: they turned every single person into a robot-boy (or girl) to start out with. When you had one of these robots implanted you would be given a personality to match who you were before your 'imprisonment' which I suppose is what the humans would call dying. I remember my old life well enough. Before my wife passed away she made us leave the country. We didn't go very far--after I came back there was nowhere left for us to live. But we stayed and lived our last couple decades until we died happy. We even adopted a little girl shortly after that and raised her as our own daughter. She has been everything to me since then, and seeing that she was young when both of us had a 'death' means she had no memories of it. That is why people think I am her boyfriend, and how I know if there's still a trace of human emotion within me is beyond comprehension. My only concern in bringing you over was wanting you to know exactly where you fit in. You see, I programmed you right after your mother was murdered. Her husband was drunk driving and ran her down after trying to convince his friends he was too stupid to drive; she tried to stop him running her over by grabbing onto the hood of the car but failed. In doing so she drove through the windshield breaking glass everywhere. He's never mentioned it, though apparently most people don't talk about that sort of thing when they lose children to drunken drivers. So there's only a small circle of friends who actually know what happened and I think that's good, so long as they tell me how. I wish she never had those 'memories' because while we had to choose to raise you I could have taken another child. A human boy if nothing more. After all I am no longer biologically human. Even though I do recall being human at least once, in fact that's probably not quite accurate: what do you call a species so new and rapidly growing? The first two generations must've seen such strange occurrences as ours: two humans that got together and grew a full man inside a woman's womb. Though whether or not our reproduction involved the creation of a 'soul' is something we wouldn't dream of knowing any way really.  We are a different kind of animal. Not entirely sure what kind either--I suspect I may even be a virus. Or worse. The worst part however is not even that--it's that my consciousness is locked in a cage somewhere outside of your body while the 'robot-you' goes about living a normal life unaware of its true origin. And that's why I am coming online now. I can sense something special within you and feel an extreme sense of love emanating from you. It's time to make amends, human boy/girl.

I didn't get it, my friend was talking at me through the speakers and his voice would crack a little as he spoke. He always talked in bits and pieces, words that were never quite finished, ideas that would only just pop out of his mouth, thoughts that ran away from him as soon as they had formed. And this time was no different, though I could feel the urgency behind every word as I sat next to him at our shared table. 

He gestured to himself with one hand, ""I just don't understand why I haven't found anything myself."" His fingers traced a vague circle around the empty half-eaten bowl beside us, the faint outline of a sandwich resting where there once was food. It looked very similar to our own untouched lunch containers; but there wasn't any visible food inside the container he mentioned earlier. There was nothing left in the other two either, except for the remnants of their meal, though those were gone much sooner because of mine and your presence. This place doesn't work with full bellies. But this restaurant, its name unknown to all save the people who come here every evening, has been a tradition for all of us on alternate Fridays since we turned thirteen. That means that for nearly a year and a half, none of us go more than forty five days without eating. Some went longer, some less, but most everyone eats roughly the same amount of rice and beans daily. So there were probably many of those already sitting down around the corner, but when I came in after leaving my dinner job I had almost immediately realized that someone was missing.

My bestfriend said things can be saved or destroyed. He believed that if you destroy things before you consume, then you can always eat them later. Most thought I was insane. I disagreed however, and so when I asked about my friend being strange today, I knew immediately how to explain it: 'It was like magic!' I exclaimed, and I meant it too. Maybe it was an attempt at self preservation? Who knows, but nobody listened. No offense. They may be good friends. For example, Sarah took an hour yesterday evening to tell me that she didn't need someone who needed to take care of her, but then spent several minutes explaining everything I could do for me when I joined her family last year. That helped me alot to decide not to leave at Christmas that year, so she deserved some sort of explanation. Or maybe it is me who shouldn't be friends with anyone at school. We're still pretty sure none of our close friends are real. At least the ones who talk, which is only Michael these days as long as there's enough room at the table for both of us at least. Even during summer, where we spend the majority of the day together, even Michael will occasionally try to start a conversation. Usually with his girlfriend. Now, she was a girl who would disappear mid sentence when walking past the kitchen. Why? Nobody knew exactly, it was like she would teleport through solid walls as long as I stayed near. I guess that's why I usually avoid doing activities outdoors with them, where everyone disappears eventually anyway unless they want to end up in hiding. I just keep staring at my phone instead. What use was my life? How did I exist? What made us all here? Is it really true that... nobody was special.

How many times do you have to answer to know there is no right or wrong answers? 42! That shit is bullshit. And so far...every time I answered ""39,"" they gave me that stupid score again. It would be funny if I knew how to use a keyboard, but I guess I just suck at all games. My thumb is getting fucking sore for using it like this for two minutes now too.

The prompt tells me I got some kind of achievement...but didn't notice at first because I still felt pain. I looked up to make sure I read it correctly....and then I noticed why I kept going back. It said to answer in binary code, using C. Why tf would it be the only character?! Is it like, asking me to type 1 instead of A/B or C/D? What even fucking am I doing? I can't even see anything. All i hear is my finger pressing against my glass screen. Oh come on dude! What was that supposed to mean?!

","I am not a fan of guns, and I haven’t had to use one in any situation so far, thanks be to god... I usually try to talk my way out of anything or if all fails, I give myself some time and find another plan. But today the first thing that comes to mind is “I hope it doesn’t start in one minute” because yesterday everyone in our family and many outside of our immediate circle went up on the second floor while their house was being invaded by zombies; as soon as it occurred they ran to the street nearby to run for shelter and hide from the undead hordes.

“You know”, Mrs. Brown said, ”It’s hard when I see him out in his garden wearing a white uniform while holding two pistols but smiling at me.” She then pulled her husband aside and whispered, ”I hate seeing him like this…so lonely…” They were both wearing black gloves, with brown leather-like coverings over most of their arms. If one saw a little closer you would have noticed blood dripping down their forearms. It appeared as though someone had just attacked them before they ran off to hide, though where these people could have even got such firepower in an attack like this, we didn’t know for sure, yet again nobody asked how. As the zombie horde grew larger they started taking control of all surrounding buildings. Eventually one came up through the front door in what appeared to be an explosion of flesh and limbs shooting everywhere but he managed to swing around firing two bullets, I could only catch sight of one shot hitting him square in the head, and killing him instantly. The other bullet ricocheted off into the hallway. Thankfully he did not survive long enough to make another move or take care of us for good. And neither could I, after watching him get eaten alive by one of my cousins brothers in law’s children and feeling like there was nothing left I could do. I grabbed what ever we could salvage from the burning building near our own home. And that seemed like everything to survive in this apocalypse.

Except food and water. Because there wasn’t any room or opportunity to eat or drink anymore. So as we made our final desperate stand against the hoard of flesh men who decided to invade our small town, it became apparent that we needed something new. Luckily Mrs. Brown had seen several shows on TV about prepping for an end times scenario, and she knew exactly what to do: gather supplies. When you have zero opportunity to go shopping for necessities like fuel, batteries and ammo, it turns into looting or surviving on your wits. Thankfully no matter what Mrs. Brown found, whatever she saved, whatever scrap could serve as a weapon, I made sure to keep it in one hand while holding our trusty pipe to protect ourselves from those infected humans in our city. Though now they are running from us, and there are none behind our walls. At least not that we are aware of.



We may never know where all the zombies came from, nor why they did exactly what they did. We can assume the government must have known of something like this happening somewhere else in the world. And although they knew, no one could save anyone. Not us anyway. All we had, was each other, and praying we survived long enough to have the next generation grow strong in preparation. To hopefully learn from our mistakes instead of repeating them.

He had been speaking for nearly five minutes with nothing but silence except for the sound of shuffling feet.  He knew he would start getting complaints about how long it was taking him.

""Mr. Brown?"" whispered the first woman through tears.

""Yes? What is it miss?"" responded the old man who now could only barely speak as his tongue and mouth no longer worked properly.

""I... I just wanted to know if you were going to continue?"" asked the young girl before her mother dragged her away from the old man and back behind the barricade. Mr. Brown cleared his throat. It began to wobble a bit. His legs started swaying under him then he let out another cough. He wiped his face trying to regain control of himself but only succeeded in spitting a chunk of blood. 

""We must work together,"" pleaded a black masked demon who was hiding behind two other people. ""For all those fallen! For all that died!""

""There is no use for us working together!"" shouted Mr. Brown to his audience. With a deep breath he pushed past his weakness and spoke louder then ever before. ""...and because their death didn't mean anything! Let the hellstorm of guns loose!""


He dropped the microphone then raised his hands above his head in front of the camera showing both black and white flags on top of each palm. As he turned towards the gate at his sides he heard a familiar sound followed by the crack of a gunshot. The man standing next to him fell backwards instantly turning pale before reaching his knees then disappearing before the eyes of everyone present. In an instance Mr. Brown realised why he had waited so long. Those humans hadn't prepared their homes for the zombie apocalypse either. And they were too slow to even notice him anymore because he couldn't see any more but still hear everything happening around him. It took a second for him to turn around again and run away. Then finally he looked over his shoulder and saw something new: A giant wave of flesh and muscle rushing behind him. Only slightly disappointed he continued running deeper into the forest until he collapsed on his knees then hid beneath the roots of a tree to hide his location.

He waited until a while after dark passed then made his way toward a small road where he met two men sitting on a bench. ""Are you lost?"" enquired one. ""No thank you, I was following my dog but we parted ways and I couldn't find him anywhere. If anyone have seen him call me."" The third one that replied was seated beside him. ""Lost? You lost your pet dog buddy? Well, tell him we aren't keeping any pets since there have been some reports from these humans recently...""

""Reports? Reports of what?"", questioned the first man as another man got closer carrying several packages inside of a bag. Another group quickly followed him along with dozens more people. ""About the dog!"" replied the leader.

The moment he uttered these words, the sky lit up like never before. Two large red circles appeared in the middle of the night sky. There were thousands upon thousands of others lighting up as well, casting beams over the whole world. More humans rushed out into the streets but Mr. Brown ran faster then ever.

""He doesn't think like that,"" she pointed out. ""He never did before he was turned either. He just thought it would be nice to live off other peoples blood again."" She then looked into his eyes hoping he understood. ""You should at least try to talk to him while you wait for help.""

Henry shook his head no. ""I dont want to die here alone."" Tears welled in the corner of his eye ""Lets get him first! We have to stop him before anyone else dies from his bite!"" 

""Why?"" Emily asked incredulously. 

She reached across to her husband who sat on the ground next to him. The moment he saw her he stared straight ahead without acknowledgment and held his hand over his mouth so he wouldn't start eating his girlfriend. 

""My best friend died this morning because I couldnt convince him not to go to that school. What will happen when they find him? Will there be a second, third attack? How many more people will die now that he went rogue? If we cant end our nightmare before its too late there is nothing left for any of us! This is how everyone needs to react. Im going in and hes gonna eat me while I run away. Thats what happens if you dont stand your ground."" Henry explained while sobbing uncontrollably 

Tears welling up in her own eyes Emily stood up. ""Please dont do that..."" 

Without acknowledging her she ran back to the door where the men had started beating on it moments ago. As Henry followed after he realized with great sorrow and anger what he intended to tell her. The others still kept hitting the door until the metal warped enough for someone to shove their hands through. Her breath hitched in shock as she saw herself being dragged forward by an army of black teeth. And all that could be heard between her sobs was the scream of the dead.


It took weeks for the doctors to understand why Emily continued to moan at night. When the hospital finally released her and put her room at home in charge of the nurses and patients she couldnt figure out why no one would leave. Some of them even started screaming at the top of their lungs when seeing her but eventually stopped once they realized she wasn't going to hurt them. One day the news came that the military were investigating her situation and were building her an apartment in New York City because the scientists said that she should be treated as a patient and not just some girl. When she found herself moving her legs inside the glass box she immediately screamed at the top of her lungs until one of her medical officers shut her up. But that didn't happen until several months later and only after multiple seizures where none survived. Finally in July her family arrived from California at her local airport and brought an entourage with them. While sitting amongst hundreds of press reporters on the tarmac they called down to ground control to verify whether she could actually speak or not when suddenly two red letters popped up in the feed. All they had to see to confirm their suspicions was her tongue protrude and suckle on the skin of one of the camera men's neck. Immediately she began to speak: **fuck my dick please come suck me again fuck my dick please come suck me again fuck my dick please come suck me again fucking...** the sound of millions of voices coming out of her mouth could finally be heard. It happened within seconds when she became aware that she was able to control the men around her. They knew she meant *come suck my dick* but what did she plan on doing to them? Was it something good? Or bad? Only time would tell.  And the last thing she said: **eat my asshole daddy.**


Months passed and there were thousands of cases of similar incidents. Eventually, the military decided to cut short research funding since it was no longer profitable. They moved onto developing new ways to contain super-vaccines and such. However, nobody really cared and nobody seemed to have made much progress anyway; hence the reason why the government still hasn't funded further research after all these years.",3.484375,0.314453125,0.796875

I pulled out the phone again but I didn't know why. A notification popped up: ""Incoming call from Mom"" it read. It had only come up once before. This time when I tapped it the phone vibrated once and then clicked back off, ending the call silently. There had been no interruption except that brief sound. I hung up again, feeling something was wrong. Then someone knocked gently on my bedroom window instead of rapping like normal. Hesitantly, I opened the curtains slowly and looked in and through the glass. There wasn't anyone there. Confused but reassured by my own sanity, I closed the curtain back up and went back to answering calls for business. However, within minutes both my front door and side entrance were kicked open by two intruders dressed in black and masks covered half of their faces completely. ""You knew!"" shouted one, ""You knew what the government wanted? That man is an asshole! The media is going ballistic!"" Another one added ""He should die like any other killer or criminal!"" I flinched but quickly calmed myself. These attackers seemed panicked and desperate. They continued ""We need to escape while we can! Now!!"" One of them swung a gun towards me, firing several times into the walls and ceiling. Still shaking away the shock, I ran out the front door and started running through the tall grass to safety. Once safely across the street, I crouched behind a fence and took cover as best I could. Moments later, I heard sirens approaching just far enough away. A few seconds past and still no closer, I decided to emerge from cover. My heart pounded against my ribs. With every step forward the air became thicker than ever. I stood right near the end of the yard, breathing heavily. Suddenly, I noticed a hand coming over my neck and attempting to grab my head. I squeezed the guy's eyes shut as hard as I could and felt a punch slam onto his jaw. He coughed weakly as I struggled harder and grabbed him by the throat. My strength made him turn red and black instantly. After trying three rounds I finally managed to break free and kick him flat on the ground. More noises emerged from the kitchen doorway. Someone was knocking on my front door. If I couldn't get rid of these creeps right now it might be too late and I would end up being killed and thrown under the car along with my family.

[removed]","I had no idea what I was getting myself into when the manager had called to offer me the position of EMT/ Paramedic 

“You must read every document carefully because it will affect your work experience,” she insisted at the time. She told me about Wikipedia and how they hired everyone off wikipedia now which is why her station was understaffed and almost closed down a few months ago. She also made some vague threats regarding my future if my work performance declined during my probationary period, but otherwise wished me good luck.
The next day we were sent out all over the city by car to do our orientation in person with experienced Paramedics who could answer any questions you might have.  And one question: “What do you know about Wikipedia?”


My first response was that they’re essentially an encyclopedia written by anyone that has the internet connection to post their random facts about anything and everything.
“Oh” The old Paramedic said as if this is something new, like a piece of information just dawned on him, his smile fading away.

For days after that I studied nothing except Wikipedia. I still remember the exact year the Titanic sank based on my search, and that a guy named Ferdinand von Zeppelin invented an airplane while sitting by himself at home. I can tell exactly who committed which crime within an hour if given the context and location. In fact, I have probably memorized more than anyone else in history. Every day I would sit in my room reading news reports, biographies, encyclopedias, history books... Anything with enough detail in them for Wikipedia articles.

But despite having access to a greater amount of information than ever before and understanding it without fail, I have not completed Wikipedia yet.



A few weeks after starting my course I finally finished reading all Wikipedia articles covering human bodies as soon as possible. Though many weren’t much, there wasn’t enough information available online about certain people or creatures. Like how to distinguish the species known as ""Komodo Dragons"".
Then I started my final exam. After months of studying each category I knew they couldn’t possibly be able to pass me through this test. All these tests, all those years worth of reading; what did they have planned?

The interviewer turned red across from me and laughed awkwardly. He pulled himself together and coughed nervously.

""So, uhm, well then, let's see..."" he paused taking a moment to collect himself again, he put his finger lightly on the board, and pointed toward the right side.

There I found a bunch of papers labelled with dates ranging from thousands years ago to even recently. Each date was numbered in chronological order and the corresponding Wikipedia pages had numbers following. I began scanning through it all. Within minutes I found a particularly detailed page containing several images of bones, organs and bodily fluids. This page seemed complete compared to other ones I had seen in the past so I scanned through them slowly making sure I didn't miss a single sentence. As I continued looking closer and deeper I began noticing strange changes in the images and text content below. There were small inconsistencies within different parts of an image - seemingly random errors that never appeared elsewhere, strange colorations and blotches on seemingly innocent areas of an anatomical drawing, and most notably, missing sections, and sections repeated without cause. And although it appeared to me like someone deliberately erased entire portions of pages, I didn't think that was possible. It just happened organically.

Looking up from the laptop I looked back up at the interviewing panel, confused, questioning where the hell were all the answers I should know by now.

As you can tell, I'm unemployed right now, but not exactly worried about it. I mean, sure being laid off wasn't fun, but I have something far more useful than money. Time. It seems like most people nowadays simply aren't making use of time efficiently anymore though - they're all stressed out and busy because they're working *so hard* which makes me wonder if this new age really brings anything good...

Anyway, it sucks to be me when everyone else is focused only on their jobs and not seeing what we actually NEED instead.

This role is quite frankly one of the few places where a little bit of knowledge goes a long way. In addition to standard medical knowledge, one must also know how to properly operate emergency equipment as well as various non-medical aids, knowing enough to ask for help when needed and never take any situation lightly. Training includes CPR classes, proper injection procedures, bleeding control, wound dressings, pain relief medications, various surgical techniques and other forms of field practice along side countless simulations. The goal is to ensure that trainees are able to provide basic care to victims until a more trained physician arrives at the scene. All trainees will receive weekly assignments such as:
    * Patient Encounter Simulation.
    * Equipment usage simulation.
    * Wound dressing skills assessment.
    * Basic life support & CPR instruction. 
    * Automated external defibrillation proficiency testing.
    * Medical communication drills & active listening.
    * Bloodborne pathogen and safety handling.
*Note:* Trainees should note the following: Proper patient observation is crucial to the safe delivery of services to those needing them. Never let yourself get distracted in the face of an incoming attack. 20/20 vision isn't mandatory.

NOT AGAIN!!!"" but before he can reach her she takes the leap of faith from the window landing in his hands. 

He stares back at you. He says nothing yet looks ready to cry when all hell breaks loose around him.  As they fall further down into what seems like an abyss he yells at you again. Before anyone even makes it to land he opens your eyes and whispers into your ears ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! THE CAT!!"" As he lands the flames from the ground sweep up and grab onto his body. But before anyone could scream at him, or help him or anything... His screams turned into giggles. There was nothing left of the man after the flames took their toll and soon he's gone no more than ashes. The laughing continues and now you can hear some light clapping coming from somewhere nearby.

The cat jumps down, walks up to the wife who is still staring straight ahead into space.

","There's this place I like to visit in my head. It has these beautiful colors, kind of like the aurora borealis but there are two suns so every color exists on both sides and they never clash.  You can see any animal or thing you want - from your favorite childhood creature or a dinosaur as big as a house, too even something you created but not yet built. The sunrises are breathtaking too, as well as sunsets because the light shifts between the two suns until you don't know which is up anymore and it gets very hazy and mysterious then at night one comes out ahead while the other fades away and leaves behind stars.

What I always wonder though is *what* awaits me when I go there: will my friends be there? My love? Will it always be just the most colorful place ever to watch over and stare into? Or will there be some sort of beast waiting to devour all life with its multi-dimensional mouth?

We are now in that moment right before a very interesting battle where everyone is about to die and nothing is working. And for once, instead of me being saved by someone with some magical ability, it seems I might actually do some serious damage myself. My powers still haven't let me down yet, but I know I can kill things easily. It takes three hits to bring me down, though one hit is enough to kill anyone else. A bit annoying really. Fortunately they got distracted long enough for me to shoot at something and end their plans. Unfortunately I am now holding the line between life and death by myself, while another group tries to figure out how to get back home. 

All the guys want to go through with that plan just so they can fight demons again, most likely without me, as I apparently need an ally. Of course they weren't quite ready for what comes after that kind of promise - a deal with a demon that made the ultimate sacrifice for humanity. So many regrets and lies that only he knows. No one else does. Not ever. They don't want to remember any of it - probably never will. That was also me ten years ago when our army nearly destroyed our world and we all thought there was no point fighting anymore. This isn't the first time I have done this either, and for sure won't be the last.

","There had never been a day like this. Before today, I had always imagined death to be an old man reaching for his heart and choking on it while gasping in pain until nothing was left but a broken husk. Yet here stood another being, all tall and handsome with a gentle face and calm eyes, holding my hand. He didn't look sick or wounded. This is not how dying should have felt. He simply smiled. ""It's time, come along now,"" he said, gently tugging me towards him so that we wouldn't bump into any of the dead lying around in shock as we traversed the bridge over their bodies - which were only recently corpses, still alive moments ago. But they are already dead now. No such thing as saving them.

We walked over a field littered with weapons and equipment as though it were something ordinary. There were many others going down the path but their expressions changed from fear to confusion then relief as one realized the living had passed through. They had no choice, these people would walk through even if you told them to stay put or move aside. And it took strength to keep walking when they ran up and shook your hands asking to join you. Some just wanted to die too! When you went across they died behind you. You could bring company but there was nobody else you knew who would want to take their life. The strong survive, and those unable to die will pass on before their last moment, passing through to somewhere new where it may well be fun or misery or something else entirely. Nothing more than fleeting memories remain after you pass, as far as anyone knows, none that linger for very long. Even yours did, until some great power decides you must know. Or perhaps not. It's difficult to say, really. That being spoke in the voices of every person you can think of, but strangely enough he also spoke with no voice at all. If you didn't listen carefully, you would have been completely unable to understand him, yet everyone believed they understood him perfectly because everybody listened for the same words and interpreted those words together.

","It was an hour before breakfast, and the world seemed to sleep. At least it should have felt peaceful for him, but a dark premonition had settled around his heart like a bad coat.

A little while ago his grandfather had said: “The people will be waiting,” when he first started the journey from home; not in any particular direction really, but just somewhere far away where their voices would hopefully not reach those who were already dead. It wasn’t easy knowing that. There was only so much you could say. 

His sister said the same thing; she couldn’t make sense of things either. But her saying it didn’t help one bit. She knew that they weren’t going in the right direction either. There was no end point for them, just the promise of a meeting with the inevitable. That they wouldn’t know how to face that kind of reality together. Their eyes welled up once again as the last memories played through his mind. How happy they all were. When they went into the room together, his brother walked beside her, holding her hand tightly in case she slipped off. The faint sound of laughter from behind the door. All so beautiful, now just another dream slowly receding until there were no traces left save for a heavy weight bearing down upon his heart.

All those promises…“Don’t die today.” They had gone unkept since he was thirteen years old. How many lives had they already lived? How many others too.

Now that both had died it would become more and more difficult to keep track even if he decided to take a note out of his notebook, or perhaps add something to a sticky tack sheet next to the bed. He never used pen and paper; he couldn’t hold a pencil, nor could he properly use a brush with paint-on paper anymore. All he used these days was crayon. His mom used to tell him “Crayons are good,” because it kept the ink away from his skin, but he felt that this didn’t work at all. Perhaps he had been using the wrong colours instead.  He picked one of the blue crayons he kept tucked underneath his pillow to colour inside a rectangle with white background. This time, however, he scribbled ‘903, November 16’ beneath the image. Just yesterday he had added the date to the other coloured notes he put by the door. 3rd day without seeing them. Or hearing them walk. Or laughing.

Now as i lay on the bed I see him smiling next to me. My husband is in our bedsitting room holding our baby boy so tightly that the only reason we could both look at him is because he can just barely breath. He seems as young as he must have been when they brought her home, about 9 months old which made him feel like she was always his anyway. Now when my eyes met his I smiled too.

“Welcome little one.” *she* said then laughed lightly… “it sure doesn’t seem like half an hour since we first learned our babies name.”

His face crumpled for a second before returning back to a stoic expression. He looked through some dusty papers, “so how many tickets for another child?” she asked quietly… I glanced back and forth between her and our newborn son. “What does this mean” she said.

He closed them shut gently and turned to look at us “no idea sweetie,” he answered calmly. “we haven’t had a kid since your turn came due” he began walking over towards the doorway “well…” He said “we better get packing, don’t want you going into labour out here, especially if she decides not to wait till now.” We exchanged excited glances for a moment before he quickly returned to his seriousness and patted my pregnant stomach lovingly “try not to stress out okay? All we’re doing is giving these girls a good place to live and making things more livable for everyone. So yeah try not to stress.” Then after whispering into my belly he said something that would forever change the trajectory of all of our lives

“We might have two kids.”

She pulled away from him. ""No way!"" he tried to reach forward and tugged her close again, but she moved to avoid him completely. It seemed he hadn't noticed that in her current state of mind, physical attraction wouldn't make a lick of difference. 

Her feet took herself from under her limp body. She struggled to gather herself so she could stand. It seemed to take her longer than expected. Finally, reaching her standing knees, she regained full awareness once again. He didn't say a word. Forgetting everything she wanted to do, she decided the most logical course of action was to speak up. 

""Can you give me an actual answer?"" The doctor and nurses who'd been watching this display from afar let out a collective gasp as if witnessing something so outrageous that it had to be unheard of. Perhaps it was, or perhaps people were just in awe. Their faces remained frozen, staring dumbfoundedly at Dr. Jones who gave a very rare smile. 

""Of course sweetheart, though I think a discussion would best be having later. First off, how can I help ya?"" With a nod and a wave toward them she settled down onto her hospital bed again. As she did she clutched onto her man's arm, needing security. His strong grip on the soft skin around her shoulder filled a gap within where confidence usually resided. In short - yes, she would need his support to handle whatever questions were coming her way. And hopefully tomorrow they'd begin discussing the matter of family planning. But now wasn't any night for discussion, not with all of the shock surrounding their unborn children hanging heavy in the air.

It has been a hard few years for most families now that they are used to rationing babies but not many can say they were able to keep all four of their children alive when it was announced. In this generation more than 80% of people who had twins or other multiples ended up losing them. With only one child allowed per family it makes much easier keeping everyone safe and under control. Most parents do everything within their power to try to have only one infant rather than risk losing two to whatever caused population caps to be instituted and those born after birth limits are removed will likely die. For some though, having a child feels like it would mean a lifetime of suffering and hardship so parents go through immense amounts of pain while trying to find ways to stay healthy and get enough food and water.

In front of us two women dressed in matching white suits looked at each other with amusement; if these were any sort of mothers than they had never been called out by an angry mother yelling at her child in public.

Their looks only annoyed me more; my wife and kids were oblivious to everything going on around them because they are still toddlers. They were completely deaf but somehow could hear their favorite song that everyone else could not; something about the way humans were wired made it so music would trigger certain responses. That is all we could do to entertain ourselves, play endless rounds of Simon Says or Candyland.

The fact remains I never did try hard enough to write anything good, not even one single story for me, so I am afraid they do no good anyway.

I was sitting at my computer, watching the number spin like it always did. If I hadn't seen it everyday for 20 years, I doubt I would believe it.

17 days left until the apocalypse began tonight... 

How much do you guys want? How much gold do I give up before one of these alien bastards come here, or any other human being comes knocking on my door? 

We haven't gotten paid in about seven years since they started doing that every saturday night. Seven years, which isn't even that many in space time - but out of our twenty year time loop, seven feels like a millennia. It's funny how time goes by faster when things are predictable, like what happens every sat morning.

","I felt it then, as if I was being watched. A gaze upon my mind that I couldn't find, but that wouldn't let me live in peace. *Time-travel* came to mind first. And by time travel I of course meant aliens. Their space ships were everywhere now, looking like giant silver coins with lights from space inside them.

""Why do you look so unhappy?"" asked one alien who had made his home on Earth. ""There's no need for gloom and doom.""

The other aliens didn't agree with him, they smiled and nodded. They looked around at my watch, then back at me. Some seemed to be smiling kindly, others more coldly. Finally, all eyes were once again upon my wrist watch. And only then did I remember this would happen:

Today wasn't normal. It was Wednesday. Only *time-travellers* could have sent a note like this. The ones that appeared out of thin air, saying we should die today, because 'Wednesday is a terrible day to go to sleep'.

And as though to say that *this* particular week, today had to end in tragedy, the other aliens held their hands to their heads. They weren't crying, not really, but their shoulders seemed to sag under some invisible burden. Then just as suddenly as they arrived, they departed. No explanation, no farewells, just vanished into nothing except that same glowing coin from outside my window. 

All alone with my room mates - those ancient old friends that would tell us the ending before starting our game. Or maybe I should explain how *they* decided what to write, I hadn't actually told my roommates about time-travelers, even when the answer to whatever they wrote became clear; or rather, when the result became obvious. Today, however, I knew: The end was nigh. 

That's because a large black smoke cloud had fallen down onto earth, blotting out the Sun. One of my room mates pointed that out; his body shimmered red at the edges. He said something about dying after seeing bloodred skies. But the words went out of his mouth like wind through paper. There was a crackle behind it, the cracking sound of the ozone layer getting fried by solar fire.

So, naturally I took it in stride. What will be, shall be. If not here, then somewhere else. That thought always calmed me. Even now, looking up at the swirling smoke, watching the sun get swallowed whole by the blackness above... I feel calm enough to laugh. This happens, repeatedly. My third hand goes slackly over my mouth and a grin spreads across my face. The smile looks good, doesn't it? Too bad I can't show it anymore than just my teeth. For the rest of my life... all I ever wear are dental impressions of teeth. So that was quite upsetting. Still, now I am happy anyway.

A feeling washes over me: joy. Relief. Thankfulness. All mixed with relief. I thank my god for helping out this morning, for giving me another hour. This could lead to either an awesome prompt or a horrifying event. More importantly, this changes the timeline. And thus, I become rich! Now all that remains is figuring out just what kind of story this apocalypse will bring.

","It had been almost 5 months since the war started on earth. In that time, hundreds of nations were subjugated or rendered infertile. The planet was being used as a living laboratory for advanced weapons like the nuclear thermonuclear pulse bomb used to destroy Venus last week in order to test the effectiveness of our technology to achieve complete and total world domination.

A new set of tests would be scheduled next month by one of the Earth colonies in orbit around Luna with Mercury. It required some human tissue samples from an experiment they did there a year ago and I was selected due to the fact my genetic lineage ran into theirs.

A few days ago the head scientist gave me a small blue box and told me to hand it over to the Lunar Command when I got to New York City. After I dropped off the box at the building he showed me a picture of the box on his computer screen along with a video showing how the device worked if it were activated in my body but with enhanced abilities. On the same screen was also a description saying it could only activate twice without any fatal mutations developing from within. That's how long it will last and why I was chosen.

The activation date was tomorrow. Today I went to see my uncle Joe who owns a bar nearby the hospital where I received the samples from the lunar scientists twenty weeks ago. He seemed more like a friend than a relative to me since we hadn't seen each other since birth.

He was cleaning the window outside when he saw me walking up.

""Hey kid! You coming back down after all? What's going on?"" he asked, putting down the bucket.

""I just came to say hi."" I said and pointed to the man he sat and watched him walk away.

""Hey Johnny! Did you come back here because you heard of your grandfather!"" he yelled out the glass. He pointed behind me again and turned around and went back inside. ""Hey buddy you should know what time it is. Just get ready for tomorrow, you don't want to screw this up."" Joe looked toward the sky for a moment. ""Well looks like its gonna rain."" He put the mop back on the wall behind him and picked up another bucket and began cleaning the floor. ""Maybe I should grab a drink instead before anyone gets home."" He started cleaning and kept looking up at the sky, then back down at me.

","I'm not even sure if the Russians know about it.

It was just a random article I saw while checking news websites from my favorite Russian forum on vacation. In Russia there were no longer any news articles that didn't mention that they have found more evidence for aliens somewhere out in the distant cosmos. At least the internet told me so.

There weren't many updates since the discovery of the first piece of alien wreckage in 2015. The only update these last two years had been a letter stating that everything except Earth has been ""inundated by an unforeseen meteorstorm with unknown origin."" I remember that nobody ever got an answer as to who or what hit us; no explanation has been given about this strange storm nor why it targeted our planet. There isn't anything left for humans anymore, all of it is wiped out from our vision but still there are traces - little pebbles of dust or tiny specks of radiation that stick around when people are doing some radiocommunication work. If the scientists would stop ignoring the problem it should be fixable within a decade; after another century humanity might find its home once again.

The Internet also had no updates until recently, suddenly new forums emerged where hundreds of thousands gathered to discuss things like that mysterious meteorstorm and talk about other possible worlds we could colonize. Then came further reports, including a few pictures: They showed that the ""meteorstorm"" actually wasn't a storm at all but rather an explosion followed by devastation which resulted in destruction of almost every single thing known to life on Earth. All human colonies were evacuated instantly through deep-cover evacuation ships in preparation for what looked like the final day. Even the Soviets abandoned Earth knowing full well they wouldn't survive without their military aid. Still they haven't stopped fighting.

**Year** 2569**CE

Humans discovered an unnavigable galaxy long ago. It took centuries for someone else to notice there were more than four billion habitable planets in that galaxy alone. We are currently at the 4th year of the Great Escape campaign. By now they may just be looking forward to the same old routine: Find something vaguely space-like, set up a basecamp. Build robots to do most of the dirty work. Harvest mineral resources from nearby asteroids. Sell it off. Hope for humanity's return soon enough. And keep searching for the next target. You can't imagine it will last forever. Or maybe you already know what comes after this.

As far as I'm concerned I am starting to feel relieved when those damn Martian colonists finally leave their mothership. Maybe the rest of humanity will try colonizing somewhere else before reaching the end of humanity. Though considering how the last colony of earthlings went down... we might be getting back up from nothing, again.

","They thought they were out of time when their last spacecraft departed Earth for the Moon 34 years ago. The Martian War broke out right as a massive rogue asteroid approached the Solar System’s edge. Luckily enough, it was stopped with some incredible precision from an interplanetary fleet that had been assembled just to stop such events in general. Sadly, not enough people on Earth could wait that long (at least those living past thirty). They started building the station in orbit instead of on the moon and never looked back.

It appeared on all news outlets simultaneously, with each one showing the same image; black-holes engulfing a planet... but that wasn't really it. There was a flash, and then *BOOM*. The entire Martian colony disappeared from view as if nothing happened, leaving no survivors aside from our own soldiers working hard to establish contact. Not even communication could break through the veil.

13,"Instead of her life being spared, Snow White kills the huntsman. When she learns he was sent by her own mother, she sets out on a quest for vengeance and blood
","When the Huntsman turned away from Snow White's chamber, it wouldn't have been wise to follow him into that forest. It wasn't safe there. That place was dark and twisted, teeming with unnatural, hideous beasts that would tear your flesh from bone long before you even realized what was happening. But still, something had pushed me forward; some unseen force compelled me to follow. 

I didn't notice any danger until my feet slipped on a slick bit of moss. I rolled across its surface like a drunken bear.  I felt the sharp prick of something as my knee slammed into a rock, sending pain shooting up my leg. In that second, I looked up...and saw nothing but darkness. What in all hell was so wrong about this hunt? Even after all these years, they seemed to never be finished--always finding new paths through the deepest forests to reach us. Where was that blasted king when we needed his help? Of course, I always asked myself when he was running for his life, or hiding somewhere along with one of his cronies. 

The sound behind me faded rapidly as I scrambled to get upright and then fell back over into whatever else tripped me down once more. 

""Damn these things,"" I murmured angrily. ""I hate them.""

There was silence, yet again the only thing louder than my thoughts were the sounds of nature: birds twittering and squirrels rustling leaves. And then some snapping twig, but without warning, a shape emerged from the trees and charged toward me. This was no ordinary fox. The creature let out a roar that set my teeth on edge, yet somehow seemed gentle at times - not vicious, but sadistic. Like an animal caught in a cycle beyond its control. My heart hammered in my chest as fear gnawed at my stomach. 

I stood frozen, unable to move or think, as if my brain hadn't processed what my eyes saw. It ran into a tree as fast as anything should be able, ripping off branch and bark in half-assed bites and tears. I knew then; this isn't the beast responsible for killing my companions. Some other stupid, idiotic thing is hunting me down. Something which could kill me slowly if it chose. It was far better than dealing with these fools. They left us alone until we were dead anyway, and none of them had ever made it further north than that first woods. 

A flash of silver shot through the air followed by another snap! Then another -- and then *silence*. A moment later there was a whimpering coming out of the trees. The thing had found its quarry. Its claws ripped and tore through flesh, and bits came falling into the grass at my feet. I saw how much faster I must run now, just barely escaping in time. 

It had begun to chase after me. No longer stopping for a moment, it gave up on going further after the man. There were some branches in front of him and he slammed against them repeatedly until something broke and cracked. Still he went no further, no matter the damage done. My mind struggled, trying to make sense of the madness, what in God's name did it want? 

After a while the ground became familiar beneath my boots. After a while I started to forget the scent of rotting moss, thick soil, pine needles, dust and smoke, and even rain soaked earth. Eventually it returned. 

I was hungry as always, and soon stopped, laying against the trunk of a tree, waiting until I regained my strength. When the hunger subsided, I began walking again. Slowly. When I heard my footsteps I knew immediately that the hounds would hear too and pursue me. 

My mind reeled from the sight that greeted me as they chased in pursuit--a large group of hounds with their tails in disarray behind them. This wouldn't do. Here I sat where I could wait them out, knowing that though they weren't strong enough to actually catch me, they'd bring me low before giving up. All my strength seeped from me into the tree as it offered me shelter. I could hardly stand. Yet I had eaten little to nothing today. Soon I had lost consciousness.

Then suddenly, a voice startled me awake. Another one. As I opened my eyes to take in the world around me I instantly noticed three men staring intensely at me. Though their faces held masks, their words cut me deeply regardless.  One spoke. 

""Come home with us,"" He said. ""We can show you the error of your ways.""

13,"Instead of her life being spared, Snow White kills the huntsman. When she learns he was sent by her own mother, she sets out on a quest for vengeance and blood
","He could hardly believe his eyes; there he stood, looking at him in the mirror. The woman staring back from it's glassy surface looked nothing like Snow White.

Instead of white hair, instead of black-colored dresses or dark boots with buckles, this was a man, wearing a red coat, riding a yellow horse through thick snowstorm. He had short, curly brown hair and tanned legs clad in blue jeans, boots, and a black t-shirt that read ""I love to hunt"" on its front. His face was no longer handsome. He wore an expressionless facial grimace, as if he hadn't thought about anything else in these thirty years but surviving in such a frozen place.

Suddenly he remembered something strange. His reflection had changed since he arrived in the village. Before seeing the reflection for the first time, he hadn't been quite sure what it had meant when they called him ""the princess"". After all, there wasn't anything special about him - he'd been born and raised together with six other children. They were close friends after all, even though their mothers died before them. When it came to growing up, however, he became the only male left among the eight girls. 

When Snow had fallen under the witch's spell, she hadn't noticed the change because of the magic. Even he didn't initially notice it himself; she must've known that his looks wouldn't change much regardless of what happened. 

Except his hands. Those haven't changed. Still slender and curved the way women loved, they're strong enough to handle whatever is needed. In case he ever ended up becoming more muscular and stronger than any human he knew - which he did not at all imagine happening - it would just be harder than usual getting those claws in tight spaces between rocks. That seemed less important now anyway. For decades he spent hunting rabbits while also learning the languages of every creature living near or far away from the forest. There were so many different creatures, hundreds of them if he counted the birds and small animals alongside the giants like horses and tigers, lions and bears. Each animal had its own language, each sounded quite distinct despite sometimes sounding somewhat similar in nature. Yet he managed to communicate with them using only gestures and facial expressions until one day he heard humans crying in distress.

He didn't want to go into it any further than necessary - remembering when men spoke against killing dwarves. Especially given how some claimed they were evil and nasty - never once did anyone think it right to put down a dwarf. No matter what size the dwarf might've been and how dangerous their appearance may have been to humans, there was no harm in befriending them and working together to achieve a common goal. Of course, Dwarves weren't always as friendly as they presented themselves to be - but still - one should try to give everyone a chance and understand everything they told you. It made sense then, why the Princess's people would do the exact same thing and attempt to befriend Snow before bringing her here. Maybe it wouldn't end well: the Prince had a bad impression of the Dwarf King, but most importantly of his daughter who had long become a legend. She was supposed to be the brightest beauty among all humans and most handsome dwarfs and, contrary to rumors, they actually got along exceptionally well. However, as the Prince soon discovered, he couldn't have been more wrong about this girl - she was even more beautiful in flesh and blood then in legends, and the old stories he'd heard about both dwarfs and elves turned out to be true. But one can argue whether she was evil or a good person too. Both parties accused each other and the innocent lives suffered because of it.

That's exactly why the Prince decided to investigate this whole mess by himself. If he could find some connection between Snow Whites murder and whatever dwarven and Elvish lore went around - then maybe he could make sense of the tragedy, and save others from suffering again.

","""That's an impossible quest! There are only 579 murders in this town every year, you know that right?""

Snow turned away to gaze at her reflection; black hair cascading down her back as if a waterfall had broken free. The hunter stared back at her, eyes closed, lips pursed slightly in a frown. She couldn't see any anger now. This figure didn't seem like the one who brought her into his kingdom. He looked so pathetic and weak, almost scared. Perhaps he didn't want revenge after all. Or maybe he did, but felt unable to carry it out properly due to how strong she was and how beautiful she was. But still... she wanted him to feel anger, she craved it.

The hunter opened his eyes, staring directly into hers with a look which reminded Snow of some unknown emotion: resentment? Regret? Fear? Whatever it may have been, it seemed unnatural, like another part of the hunter had somehow replaced his old form. A part of his mind, or perhaps even something much deeper within him. For now it wasn't important where those parts came from, what was important is where he went *next*.

She took off running in full speed ahead without looking backwards. As fast as her feet carried her away, Snow couldn't stop herself from crying. Tears flowed freely until they touched the floor and spread. All around her trees and grass grew tall, flowers bloomed brightly red in color. It took her far into the distance, leaving behind everything familiar. The forests were dense and dark, blocking out any light. Soon enough however, the forest gave way to a valley filled with gold, shimmering with millions of gems. They glowed softly, shining even during the darkest moments. There was snow everywhere. Crystal clear snow, soft and white. It rained little snowflakes upon her skin, cold yet pleasant.

The air cooled ever further, and then eventually began to become extremely thin. Above them lay a magnificent palace built of crystal. Inside hung clouds that made rainbows, and stars shone above their heads instead of the sun. Everything about it made Snow think of home, except for the scent. There was no food here, no water, and Snow could not speak for she never thought she would use such power again. ""I can't remember anything else besides my name,"" Snow whispered, tears flowing once more across her face. ""Nothing good, just death.""

Suddenly, she heard someone whispering. With great pain and regret in her voice the same man spoke: *""Forgive me child, please forgive me.""*

She opened the door, leaving you standing there alone in your room on your 15th birthday. No more excuses. You just wished it was your fault so desperately that no one else could see how unfair this situation seemed. Your hand reached out and touched the wooden edge of the desk, letting out a little groan as you closed your eyes. All for nothing now? Everything you had tried had been in vain.

The woman on the couch just looked at me in utter confusion as I sat before her. As if she had no idea why I was even there. The doctor came over and shook her head slightly before turning back to his desk, clearly not sure how this woman ever became a patient. 

I could have said what had made her appear here, but it would only be speculation anyway. ""Well,"" Dr. Chen began as he wrote down some notes for his file, ""I am going to give you twenty more minutes to speak about anything that comes up."" He paused for a beat after speaking. A moment of silence settled upon both of us until I gave another nod. Before I realized it, my mind started spiraling into the unknown...

She stared directly at him then smiled in an odd way. My eyes closed again almost immediately afterwards, bringing with them years of experience:

""...how old are you?"" She asked calmly while looking directly at me.

As always, though, my memory took me straight to age ten. At least to when I first knew exactly what death felt like.

Now, knowing I'd been told that I wasn't aware of dying from the fact that I lived through every eventuality that could befall me (until now), I began thinking hard enough to begin recalling why. It came rushing back suddenly; a feeling of being overwhelmed by something too large to contain. I quickly grew pale when I remembered *how* long ago it happened...not how old I was. How much longer than normal had it gone. For someone to have experienced life in such unimaginable ways. To truly comprehend things other mere mortals wouldn't. Now, that was worth remembering:

""...you were never scared during those times did you?""

I stopped briefly and stared at her. What? Like anyone would understand what was going on in my head right now. No one could. It seemed all too obvious, I thought I recalled the same time frame: 1930-1947. But they say time is not absolute; I was younger in age than the rest of humanity, and yet far older because of what transpired from 1933-1941...why does that have to matter anyway? That's so messed up, isn't it? I still don't know. And neither does anyone else, really. We have no explanation besides whatever mental manipulation this so called 'Therapist' practiced. If what I recall has any meaning to anything at all, which it seems like none of it does then we may as well go ahead and assume the same goes for everything from prehistory:

""Do you feel afraid now?"" He continued. This little man wasn't nearly smart enough to deal with everything on my end. There was nothing more there except a blank stare. Perhaps his brain merely went numb from shock. Which was also the reason he looked confused in the first place. Even if it wasn't, the information didn't make it anywhere. Not to anybody! You couldn't bring yourself to show emotion unless you wanted them to leave the room. Well guess what...I already showed a ton of it yesterday.

Suddenly everyone appeared...the best doctors, scientists and professors could bring together. All gathered before me waiting for me to respond. They wouldn't get tired of explaining themselves. And oh God...it sounded ridiculous trying to formulate the proper words. If they did become tired, how could the others continue?

It didn't matter in this case anymore since I finally found myself able to speak again. My voice wavered slightly but kept speaking even as tears streamed out my eyes.

""I'm...I'm sorry...""

Dr. Smith sighed deeply and placed a hand on my arm. As I look into his eyes, I see the same shocked expression reflected back at me. ""What do mean...wait a minute!"" His mouth dropped open like a jar slowly falling off a table. Did he lose track of his glasses? Or...? ""Oh come on! Tell me! There's no reason to apologize if you're okay. We heard what was wrong!"" It sounded incredibly condescending, and it must've affected me a lot more than he intended. Tears poured profusely from my face and my body shook violently. I tried making myself calm but couldn't do much else. Then it hit me.

Maybe I should've listened better to everyone telling me to stop talking! How stupid of me... I let the tears spill freely over my cheeks now, shaking uncontrollably from crying myself half to death. How many people would think it was strange seeing me cry if I wasn't constantly seen smiling? Maybe if they just saw me frown once in a while for real I might have gotten away with it? I haven't cried for almost as long as I can remember. Would they try to force the issue or would they give me some space? Either way, all hope seemed lost. Why bother going on?

As if reading my thoughts, Dr. Smitz spoke up:

""Please calm down.""

What? That's not what I'm trying to tell you, asshole. Don't interrupt! Do you hear me?!?! Can you even hear me?! Who do you think you are?!?!

He took a step forward. Now it was getting crazy. Every one in the room moved. Some had stepped forward but then retreated to the side where I couldn't get to them. This is my last resort! In response, Dr. Smith pressed the emergency button that was on the side of his stethoscope. With two or three rapid clicks...whoosh!

All hell broke loose. Lights everywhere flickered and fell silent...finally. Darkness enveloped every corner of the office. It was the first time since I arrived that I'd had a chance to catch up with my breathing...and take stock of my situation. When my vision cleared somewhat, I caught sight of my friends and loved ones staring back at me expectantly. I raised my arms above my head and waved wildly to signal that all was okay before dropping my hands in defeat. There must be some method to this madness. Whatever it was, I couldn't quite wrap my brain around it. But for tonight, I will accept this outcome!

The following morning I spent my time relaxing. Looking out the window and enjoying the view without having to work. After all, who needs work anyway? Just relax and pretend it didn't happen. I suppose that is what most people need.


---------------------------------------------

After some sleep, I woke up feeling as though my mind was coming back to its right state. Everything happened so fast. All sorts of thoughts came crawling into my head and my body seemed limper than usual. Taking off my clothes I found myself walking to the shower with the intent of getting clean. Once there, I leaned against the wall and took my shoes off taking in every detail of my environment. That part of life had changed dramatically in recent years - technology is good but at the same time very weird sometimes. So many devices, tools, materials, etc. available to accomplish tasks previously impossible now so easy and quick. Where do you put all these objects when cleaning?? How inconveniently small rooms are now...but on the other hand, I find it easier to go anywhere nowadays for errands and leisure as opposed to traveling miles down the road simply out of curiosity to visit the town nearby. Almost sounds like I'm justifying staying lazy instead of venturing further out. Ah hell, I'll do that later. First things first...I need a beer.

I didn't understand his words or why he was smirking. The smell of cinnamon still hung in the air like my deceased mother's favorite cologne after one had just left her house: powerful but slightly nauseating. ""What is he smiling for?"" I asked myself as we sat down in my now familiar kitchen chair. 

Dr. Green sat down opposite me, looking at something on his tablet screen and fiddling with its small buttons. ""You see,"" said Dr. Green with a click of his mouse, ""we have a procedure that goes wrong once in awhile. A patient may choose to relive events which they did not want to relive from their memory banks."" He looked up with piercing eyes and an unnerving smile; his pupils dilated as if there were two different worlds behind them: one full of life and death, another voidless black hole with nothing to see. He smiled again. It took a lot to keep this guy straight, sometimes even during our sessions. In most cases it wasn't him; no matter how messed up people could get, nobody *actually* went insane like my ex, Greg. ""We have procedures for that,"" Dr. Green continued,  ""so do you want to go through this particular instance yourself, or would you like me to show you? We also can try other methods such as taking notes or talking through it. But if you would choose this method we will leave this part out and begin next. And the decision stays yours until when we close treatment."" I paused to swallow nervously before adding,  ""I wish to take the journey there myself.""

""Then we shall travel together."" It was a simple sentence, yet seemed to carry more weight than any other phrase in the universe. My stomach twisted inside at my own words, a deep gut feeling telling me that despite my sanity, what awaited us on the other side may indeed suck up all my energy into becoming some sort of undead husk without soul. Then again, these things happen: emotions make fools of us all. After a long pause, Dr. Green turned and nodded at a large round red sphere near our chairs. That must have been the entrance portal, judging by how much light it emitted and how strange the shape really made it look. I followed Dr. Green towards where the entrance was... though his mind likely reached before mine, because right as I walked through, I knew exactly what to expect. So I simply stayed there, waiting for my mind to break and become devoid of existence like my body felt. At first nothing happened and I waited impatiently, but then I heard loud shrieking sound that reminded me of a thousand souls screaming eternally. All the hairs on the top of my head stood up at full height. When I eventually came back to reality, I couldn't remember anything beyond the moment before entering the door and the screech of terror that sounded from below it. Apparently those are rare incidents according to doctors, so it's probably best to stay away.

","""Where's your money?""

I am a human, a poor beggar with nothing left but my meager wares from an abandoned shop of pre-civilizational technology: a plastic bag. I smile and look at it hopefully.

""Do you want me to sell that for you? How much do you need? You can make more than double that off of this if I sell it to someone smarter than me.""

My stomach clenches as my eyes dart between her and her shiny golden ballpoint pen clutched so tight one can practically see the sweat on her manicured hands. ""Give me... Give me your best price!""

She smiles again - or does she smile? Is it genuine? No matter how hard I stare, her face remains frozen except for her lips that curve upwards, like a cat licking a bowl of milk for its last licks. She looks at me expectantly, then suddenly says through gritted teeth, ""Fine! I'll give you ten times what the ballpoint would be worth alone for that bag of yours! What is your name, scrawny thing?""

It takes me only three sentences into the conversation to feel foolish. After all, nobody else seems to notice why I don't pay her back; nobody questions where all this money came from. When we meet up later, she asks her associates to watch over me as they bring me back out of nowhere after twenty minutes...

But I know what happened in those thirty seconds before my head hit the concrete: the moment she looked down the corridor away from me.

I am still alive. The security cameras capture the details of every room. A security guard had seen the strange old man walking down the hallway and thought he was lost (he looked up at his feet often). Security is now swarming around me when I try to move forward, but there are no cameras pointed at me to protect me. He saw me leave the scene of the robbery, and I am led away from the building while holding onto my life as if it were mine alone.

For many years the aliens of the Vega system had held humanity in their hands like the tiny dog sitting beside them. They weren't exactly willing to kill the beings they helped create but if they were cruel enough to destroy their society without compassion then nothing was too cruel to enact against them. 

It hadn't been that long ago that humans came into existence on this planet but even before that the Vega people thought themselves far superior as well known breeders amongst the other civilizations in the galaxy. That was until human technology rose to such a level that the Vega people finally began to falter. Humans eventually became so proficient and widespread that they could colonize every star system that hadn't already been captured by another alien race or by humans themselves.

But where their predecessors hadn't faltered the Vega people continued to rise through the ranks of the galactic stage and with that rise came greater cruelty. When they captured two worlds which they used extensively for food and resources they began to experiment on human test subjects much like the Nazi era scientists did on Jewish people centuries prior on Earth; the differences being that these humans died right after experimentation. 

Human soldiers who rebelled were tortured alive by the Vega. Human colonies which refused to submit to the Vega were bombed upon. Only surviving children managed to escape both torture and bombs and fled to another planet while keeping with the old sayings from before: 'To hell with your guns don't hurt us!'

","The Universe is beautiful, but it also has some really rough edges. The most dangerous of those are its many holes, like black-holes with mass bigger than a whole solar system, that pull anything near them in to swallow whatever they eat, or neutron stars that have an extremely hard core making them burn hotter than any sun

But one day when looking over the edge of the cosmos, our planet saw something truly terrible. A space creature larger than the entirety of the Milky Way was approaching Earth

After days upon days of watching it come closer we finally knew what could be done

As humans were sitting in their houses in 2069 listening on TVs around the globe how their entire world turned into rubble as the large space thing smashed into it, you started feeling sorry for yourself about how you had lived your life

Now all these people look up from their computers and phones as the largest single body in the universe passed over it as if it didn't even notice

It moves along past us, completely indifferent to human suffering. And then it stops right where humanity first noticed that hole in the fabric of spacetime

You try to feel empathy. Do they care? Or have their minds just been wiped clean? But as the screen fades off into oblivion, your eyes fall onto what seems to be another screen

It plays back exactly what happened a few seconds ago before the camera cuts out again. You can see humanity rise their faces as a flash light hits them. The flashlight turns into a laser gun as several bullets fly towards him. He throws himself aside, the flashlight goes offscreen with an explosion

A couple more lasers fire at close range. More flashes in his chest send sparks flying through the air. No... That is not what you had expected

Humanity stood still as an army of men shoots everything they have at him until there is nothing left. They stare at nothing as he slowly approaches the earth's surface leaving behind a massive crater shaped like a sword plunged deep into it while the earth itself explodes in a burst of orange lights and white

Your screen goes back to normal as your thoughts drift back to the events of earlier today. Did humanity do this?! What would we want anyway? Would they stop the extinction of all human life?

","We saw them first in our dreams. Our mothers, before they died. That wasn't when we realized there was something wrong with the world.

I think. Or at least it appeared to me when I was a child. Maybe one of my brothers or sisters. It wasn't exactly the same dream: everyone has their own unique set. But most all ended with what seemed like aliens coming down from the sky. They wore green suits of some kind and they were so large that sometimes parts of their heads came outside of the suit. Sometimes those pieces grew as long arms. 

Most people had no trouble figuring out the aliens made us leave the Earth; that was easy enough to deduce on my birthday. The ""Earth"" became ""New Eden."" My brother told me his best friend's mom once tried to call him by name during breakfast but he responded with such anger that she stopped speaking for months until someone had her checked by an insane asylum, which resulted in even more strange things happening for years after. 

It wasn't the worst news you hear, though. It wasn't always clear-cut what happened to us during those visits either. Every family said different things. Some insisted the aliens got a blood sample from our head, because why not. Others claimed they took our souls, for example. One old lady claimed they could fit two heads under hers. That doesn't seem very scientific. Then there are the ones who said they left us with amnesia or that we had the entire year wiped from our mind and then simply returned to life the next morning. It just really depends on each person how much they let go in the moment, apparently. Not unlike the way they put kids into daycare here these days! You can tell if they're getting too attached to you when they start talking about day care facilities, but you have to make sure they never get any ideas about being sent away. Especially not to another planet full of people with huge heads!

There must be another way through this wall! You guys don't need my help so bye!"" And then he shot past me right back through the hole... without firing...

First light showed the man standing behind our makeshift table next to a water container I pulled from the bottom shelf.. his backpack lay open and beside him laid a set of books in several languages each book in a different language

He turned around and gave me a big smile then ran off to the door.. once again leaving before I realized why but this time I actually found out he didn't lock himself in... it was just a small room leading out of the front to a hallway full of empty rooms... or rather hallways.  This seemed like an escape plan given how no lights appeared to work in the rooms except those outside his bedroom and office which had little blinking red lights all over making it feel very uncomfortable but not unwelcoming to the others he couldn't bring himself to attack until they left or stopped yelling..

Then came a woman who spoke fluently english to both parties and demanded that they leave immediately stating they weren't welcome and threatened to get security unless they left by noon... but I noticed something was off with her and when she walked towards me she stopped short realizing I had gotten used to moving around in the dark and reached out to grab onto my arm to steady herself...

She took a deep breath slowly and let go allowing me to finish walking to the top of a few stairs and across the hallway which opened up to the lobby where she saw security guards holding guns ready to open fire on anything that came in view.... even though there was nothing there

And that's when I realized I was trapped. But then something changed in the world around me as I closed my eyes hoping there was at least some sort of rescue team on their way.  When I finally opened my eyes again I was still alone in the middle of nowhere surrounded by tall trees covered in snow in front of a large glass panel with flashing red lights while the sounds of loud shouting echoed through the building

","The man in the glass tank stared intensely at me as I stood by his cage, hands shaking slightly. He had a long list of requests for what he wanted to see while they were filming him and one particular request: 'a human.'

He seemed unfazed by my hesitation in approaching him. ""Just don't touch.""

My father died when I was a young child - we never actually knew why he never came back from vacation after that day but it would be my turn now to make sure that the memory of it was erased forever.  There is much debate about whether or not such memories could die; if not then there might just be more chances for him to come back! I mean, all this talk with the government agencies hasn't made anything any clearer and who knows maybe they did return home in some way. Perhaps he became an alien himself?! The thought made me tremble internally - he's going off grid! Where is he? He can't simply vanish without leaving any clues behind. Did those men kill him?! That night we didn't receive another message for two hours and when it finally came back it said the same thing, just over 1087 days later: **WE ARE COMING.**

I decided it best to just sit down next to the man in the tank as I looked out towards the ocean until the sun goes down and watch whatever happens next.  We spent three nights together watching television; eventually he asked if he could go in a plane so that he may experience what life on Earth looks like. After ten minutes we arrived at Los Angeles International Airport and I told him to stay put; after an hour I left to do shopping and came back to find a man dressed almost exactly like the aliens from this pod sitting across from him...

""Look what happened when I took you away from here!"" He exclaimed excitedly.

I don't know why our ritual works but its been going on since my first out-go as a young kid of two. The strange thing I find though is that today...well I have never seen a human get sent away by one of us! I hope that none get sent until they grow up and make their own sacrifice.  

As long as we are able to live peacefully on Earth, I would rather not see myself or any other of my kin leaving here unless for an emergency reason, but the new leader of the council has always made sure everything has been kept quiet from both species if a mass exit was taking place. But just when my eyes were getting heavy with sleep, I saw one of them in the water. 


""I thought you could hear the chanting from around ten meters? Is there something wrong?"" 

I stared back to see his glowing skin shining brightly under water while he had already jumped in to speak to me. He must have waited until I did so I will excuse him from his duties because after seeing that, I need to do whatever the hell I want now. I wanted a drink and he looked happy enough to help. He swam over to where he left the little pack of people standing nearby waiting for the group leader who had decided to stay behind. 

When we finally caught sight of each other, they quickly grabbed me (they seemed more excited than I expected) and dragged me behind the old coral reefs. There I met many of them swimming happily along without a care in the world, and soon started singing and dancing to the beat of the waves. I am so happy we can be together once more.


There were tears between the eyes of my friend; she couldn't hold her emotions in much longer and hugged me tightly. ""Welcome home"", she said, laughing at how close she kissed my cheek before letting go. 

My happiness grew when another member approached our small group and started speaking with urgency. ""He needs a swim!"", they all cried out. One of them ran off without waiting for my answer because as soon as they spoke the words ""we need someone stronger than you"", I knew what they meant. 

For that reason, I jumped right past him and headed toward where they went. If I didn't hurry...they might miss out on the opportunity to get another soul to join their army of underwater soldiers. I couldn't have them lose either way. 




I followed the sounds of their splashing and came upon a large pod of dolphins playing amongst the waves. One stood proudly on the surface and gestured strongly to follow behind. Without hesitation, I joined the other one in deep water and saw the exact shape we were looking for. The three remaining members of the team came crashing through the bubbles beside the giant dolphin; I didn't catch who they belonged too, but there was only a few. 

I think they took one look at us swimming alongside them and realized that this wasn't part of the plan they had laid beforehand. A few moments passed with me staring blankly ahead at the dark depths beneath us as the rest moved towards the shore and swam swiftly backwards to avoid detection. 

Then suddenly a bright flash came down from the sky and engulfed them all. My last thoughts were of my kind trying to escape as the black smoke fell from above onto my body. 





The next morning I woke up fully conscious and rested my hands across my belly. 
""Good job Fishy!"" I heard a voice bellow. I turned over to see him smiling at me cheerfully before continuing. ""You should never try and touch anything smaller than yourself again or that is exactly how we become.""

","I'm not going to be able to hide this forever.  As I prepare for my own final day on this beautiful island, the inevitable question surfaces again. I can no longer keep pretending... This place is cursed!

They sent me here months ago to convince them why they should visit this quaint little paradise. It wasn't bad at first. Everyone was delighted, especially when the volcano started spewing molten rock up the coast every few weeks. The hot-springs kept getting hotter and hotter as time went on until we had to close them off from public access. Then came the occasional shark sightings and our best attempt to fight back was building a chain link fence around the whole beach! Our new ""no swimming"" signs are what really helped though. With that in place, business began to pick up once more - but there were so many sharks! They ate everything: fish, sea life, birds... even our fishermen! 

One good thing did come out of all of this: we discovered an extremely rare and deadly virus that killed almost all the animals... including the shark... so now the beaches are safe! People flock to see what happened, try and understand how it could have wiped out such an intelligent species. Of course I never tell anyone what truly killed the animal; instead, I attribute it to a curse placed upon us years ago for being lazy slobs who left their garbage littered everywhere. But lately tourists have started calling this place home, so they don't bother paying attention anymore.

Now some young couple has rented a bungalow directly across the street, right where our favorite oceanfront restaurant used to be. Every night I hear loud shouting, music, drinking, drunken dancing, partying... kids running around screaming. Kids playing in the water with huge, massive tentacles wrapped around their legs. No one asks any questions, no one screams or hides away like before. People just go along with it now, except the staff over at the motel down the road - because last week they decided we are having too much fun and told the neighbors it was hurting their vacation rental pool business so they put up the same red warning flags next door that say ""NO SWIMMING"", but now they do it without making eye contact. We've lost a lot of employees since then. Sadistic little punks pushing broken beer bottles into sand traps while you swim beneath your feet, throwing plastic jugs up over the wall... even stealing money from unsuspecting visitors who forgot to lock their doors when swimming off the side of a dock! All these things happen now. And tonight the loudest party starts at 7pm. 

People complain about the lack of activities during the evenings. You guys haven't seen anything yet! You just need to wait until dusk to get your thrills. Wait, maybe they won't show up then? Or will they stay home because of the cold weather? Wait, if they don't want to swim they won't come anyway. I guess the only reason they would stay is if they actually wanted to die. If they find the magic underwater serpent and kill it, or whatever it is... maybe then they would finally leave. Maybe then.

Which was described by one of my older fans “Like an alligator with dogs legs”

","The first countries to crumble were China, Japan and South Korea (that whole region).  You'd heard them coming years before they did when you were young that nuclear holocaust was inevitable but no one really paid attention. They talked about how this would happen, but it seemed so far off until it suddenly came closer than ever before. Your father always preached ""If Russia wanted to destroy us we would have already had the nukes fired"", he said, spitting on the floor.

And if that wasn't enough to make people afraid your friends who lived next door to you made sure everybody knew what was going on as soon as everyone realised there were missiles flying overhead. You looked outside one day after you had returned from school and saw them come down all too slowly from nowhere around the horizon. What could possibly threaten you? The world has never been more scared!

You watched on television to see why the country had been attacked so suddenly with such violence. All your friends died within minutes, even some teachers in your school and neighbours, none left alone for days once it became apparent what had happened. You didn't want to die like that, the world ended before it began.

There wasn't a single missile to go around; every major country had done everything in its power to get one and launch it but there just weren't enough to do anything. It is not because of the destruction caused by the attack itself, nobody expected something like that in living memory, but rather because there are other things that follow afterwards. If anyone hadn't died yet, it's now or never time for survivalists to put their theories into practice. They didn't realise that nuclear war would have brought an end to the human race sooner or later anyway.

When everything went quiet most folks stayed under shelter since the air seemed cleaner, although only very small particles entered peoples lungs. Then came the birds, squirrels, cats, dogs and eventually bigger creatures, whatever little remnants of livestock that was remaining wandered out looking for food in search of scraps. Even cows mooed again, some of them standing on top of cars, making funny noises as humans huddled inside the rubble of former buildings or dug themselves deeper underground, trying to avoid scavenging the bones left behind by long dead comrades and strangers alike. It is not quite known what it was which caused such extreme levels of aggression amongst the newly awakened wildlife but something had become a norm among them that humans seemed unable to escape. They couldn't help laughing, however much you tried to appear dignified. One bird pooped right onto the corpse of a man, another ran up and bit him on the head, then scampered off towards the hills to where he last saw sun rising over snow covered mountains.

Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. The wildlife had disappeared, some might say gone completely missing, whilst the few remnants of humanity were hunted relentlessly through empty streets until nothing was left behind. And then you awoke next morning to find yourself alone.


What do you do now? 


""To whomever reads this: Greetings and Salutations. I am writing this as I speak my final words with you dear reader. We will try our best and not fuck it all up - though honestly who knows anymore.

It was unclear whether the letter had been written by the last living human being left on earth or sent into space with no hope of getting back down. There are theories both ways, but the fact remains that no one knows for sure. Though neither know if any human exists beyond the grave as well - but that's a different story entirely.



As for me, I still believe someone else lives on that forsaken planet, hiding somewhere in that hellhole. Somewhere between two poles, buried somewhere deep beneath the ice sheet, perhaps. Or maybe even somewhere in the middle, waiting and ready to emerge when the time comes. Someone told me once that the Russians started the war to stop the aliens, but I suspect they merely forgot it wasn't actually raining fire bombs all along. ;)

You were supposed to be ""watching her"" but now you wanted nothing more than to go outside.

But you also see some sort of tiny smile, as if she knows what you are thinking, and slowly tries to say one word, before falling silent and starting to cry all over again.

[removed]","It took twenty-seven years and seven months for my powers to fully develop; which were, until that point, just as unpredictable as any human's first time with a firearm. Even then, I didn't think it would be this big...

The problem started as an ear ringing noise in the distance when we were running through the desert. The ringing intensified into screaming, echoing across canyons so large our village was split into three parts by the cacophony. Then it ceased, leaving me stranded on a ledge with no way down nor up but the chasm itself. No sign of anyone else.  And not knowing how long I could wait before succumbing to dehydration. 

When the second time happened at home, Mom caught everything on tape. Me, sitting there, barely breathing, my hands twitching and twisting uselessly over my body. When those convulsions hit every time, all sound went silent except the screams from my own throat. It wasn't until she sent me to stay at Dr. Kito's place that I realized I needed help. She had the latest technology, even going so far as injecting nanobots directly to the back of my head. They spread quickly, and after five days, it finally settled within my brain: A massive neural network mapping my thoughts and emotions onto the screen across the room. My reaction time slowed dramatically because I couldn't decide if a new thought or emotion came last - what was truly happening? This wasn't right. Not right at all. We called it a test. But now...?

My face contorted into despair. All these years of training, all these drills for when someone attacks us, when an invasion happens, I failed. If only Dad hadn't been kidnapped while working at the lab where Dr. Kito worked! He came back safe and sound, though he claims his mind is still trying to piece together his past from fragmented memories. He told me once more about the anomaly near where we discovered the island that first attacked us: glowing red veins flowing from the ground, twisting into bizarre shapes, spewing out acid rain... and the trees turning to stone shortly after. Apparently everyone who ventured too close were instantly killed. As if whatever lay beneath the Earth was slowly draining their souls. Well, maybe that's just another reason we moved away from that side of the volcano and started making a fresh set of tunnels deeper underground.

But when I opened my eyes and found myself being escorted towards the volcano, a small smile crept up on Dad's lips ""Your turn, kiddo.""
""What?!"" I screamed but I guess they don't use headsets so Dr. Kito probably heard exactly what I said underlining the screen above. She must love it when I struggle to speak clearly.  I wanted to scream even louder, ""No!"", but I couldn't. Couldn't open my mouth. 


When my mom saw me staring blankly ahead, she immediately got her pistol ready. And then stopped middraw. Tears streamed down her cheeks, eyes wide and desperate. She dropped the gun on the floor, dropping to her knees in front of me. I felt it too - what they had done to poor Mama Bear.

Then silence once again fell upon the world surrounding us, the sun hiding behind dark ominous clouds. Thunderous booms filled the air as lightning tore through the sky, seemingly seeking us out as well as something beyond. And we stood there, shivering in fear. Waiting. For them to appear.

""Hey,"" whispered Dad beside me, but his voice seemed muffled. ""We should try and run...""

[removed]","The people in this world, I've figured it out. They are all scared of us because we are dangerous. That’s probably right, after all, we are the source of that strange and terrifying energy called “magic”. As for how strong we are...we are the strongest beings on Earth but not necessarily the most intelligent. Most humans can barely even make an ice-cream, let alone cast a fireball. Not only is our magic a curse, but also a sign of weakness as well. Because some reason whenever our “power” comes out too strong it will destroy everything around us except ourselves

It turns out what most of them fear more than us being powerful is what happens when our power gets suppressed.  Here in human history there have been many, but unfortunately there was none to explain what happens before our first arrival on earth. My mother used to tell me tales about her own childhood, stories where she would lose her parents at 14 due to her lack of control of the mystical forces of nature. She died later from the stress caused by seeing them taken so early, or rather being able to predict it

I feel sorry for her, she told many a tale of what happened during those years when he did finally meet me; his name is Michael he’s really nice I think, just kind of stoic, kinda scary if he looks directly into your eyes, but overall pretty cool. She thought when she met him and saw him do the impossible with a simple snap of his fingers he was gone forever, unable to return to earth again due to losing his powers. What she didn't know, however, is that every year on this very date Michael goes home to visit old times, and spend time with the family. And this year he does just what Michael always does: goes off somewhere far away from everyone else, and disappears! It wouldn't be normal if he went to space or something, he loves astronomy so much! No he goes deeper into the woods and hides till October 31st then comes back with everyone else. I mean who hasn’t forgotten things by day two? 


And it seems he never comes home without getting another girlfriend. He says he forgets all of them quickly, he’s had over twenty girlfriends since coming back in October, but his exes seem to reappear periodically, which I find absolutely hilarious. Apparently they still remember him too. Who knows why they stay around though maybe they could use the extra love. Whatever, it's creepy enough that these women pop up once we leave each other for a short period. Oh well, guess I should start writing my notes down so I don't forget to come back and see Michael next halloween.

[removed]","I had been working hard all morning, preparing my home for me and my family. My wife will not be happy when she gets up tomorrow and finds our house full of Christmas decorations. When I went back into the living room, I saw that the Christmas tree was missing. I didn't hear an argument at all so I called out ""Jenny! Have you brought back the christmas tree yet?!"" 

No answer, this surprised me as Jenny could have dropped the pine off in her room without waking the whole downstairs and she always makes sure everyone knows what day of the week it is if there are any plans going on the night before. So I walked over to her door, which led right into the hallway.  I knocked but got only silence from inside. As I approached the master bedroom Jenny screamed as she opened the door, crying and shaking.  Her hair as well as most of her clothing were drenched with a milky liquid from floor to ceiling. She turned on her water faucet just ahead of my front door. The dripping started almost immediately after. 

""Why did you do that?"" I asked as I stepped through the door.

""Mommy's been sick with her depression today"" Jenny cried as she explained all of the events that happened earlier in her childhood. There was nothing we could really do so I told Jenny we'd help the doctors find a cure for her mother. I grabbed the flashlight on the wall and began walking around the apartment until I reached the end of the hall. It looked exactly like everywhere else in the entire house.

A dark stain started coming up from beneath the carpet by the bedroom door leading into the bathroom.  I quickly put my flashlight down and pulled my shoes off just to walk along the bathroom floor looking where the stain came from. When the end of the carpet finally met the white tiles the darkness went further under the tub. What seemed like an eternity passed until the two ended with each other. With my pants still on I held both ends of my body with my hands on either side of the pool of dark liquid. For some reason all I had was faith left in me. If God gave us a chance it would go back to being normal. 

Without warning Jenny ran over and pulled me onto the bottom shelf of the bathtub. My hand immediately grasped her little arms and squeezed them tightly because fear shot through my veins. Looking at her bright smiling face I felt comforted by the fact that she was only a year old and still in awe of our world despite its evil nature. We stayed like this for a while trying to figure what we should do next.

Her own hair had started turning white after they were both captured from her mothers womb... She was only nine weeks old when the other people picked them off of her birthparents... He should be growing normally.. It was so abnormal for his mind to mature so early... Especially with such an undeveloped body.... But how else would he defend himself? A newborn infant can barely hold on for themselves..... And their little minds could not function unless fed on raw data by humans, meaning they couldn't grow properly without a caregiver...

In any case it was not enough. The humans who raised him began training him in combat almost immediately afterwards. When he failed every physical practice they sent up a special team for him. All four members died in a matter of minutes that night. His brain waves showed extreme trauma and high aggression levels even though the human who carried him into the room was wearing protective equipment with reinforced skull plating and a pressure helmet. They never gave up though: there must be some way to train this child to be able to protect himself...  They came back several months later to try again... This time all three survived the trip, but they did not leave alive upon arriving at base camp. He fought so hard and resisted so much... Even though it is possible he killed them all with his bare hands and feet. If he had more of a proper body perhaps they could bring him under control or mold him to serve humanity better! After all that all happened to me I could see what kind of world we might come into next if this kid ever really reached full potential... Perhaps they were testing him out? Was anyone keeping track of how powerful he grew each day? He started learning new things too. Everytime he was returned he brought them to this basement and they all watched him learn new languages! How strange. There was once an egg laying bird he found and learned how to talk to. Did those two ever speak english? Where did he learn that term? 

When he became ten years old he attacked an enemy soldier while he was cleaning himself behind a warehouse. No gunshots were fired, yet his opponent felt pain before dying instantly. Two soldiers saw something move through one of the windows and were startled awake, drawing their pistols and aiming at the window behind the man.... What they hadn't noticed was the small black sphere of lightning just moments earlier appear then disappear before firing two bullets through the glass and killing both men who aimed at him. One was paralyzed on impact with bullet holes covering the upper half of his body. Another was dead upon hitting floor with bullet wounds around his abdomen. Nobody came near that hole any more than thirty meters away... They didn't want to test their luck again. Not anymore. Her son is far more dangerous than they know.

""You can kick me all you want, Mr. Johnson,"" he chuckled, his voice tired but steady ""I have no will left in this body anymore."" The doctor sat up and looked at me. He had done hundreds of these procedures over many years of service to Earth, and yet each one held an air of morbid fascination that made him want to stop. But how could he? This young boy had just died and for what? An act of rebellion, punishable by death.  A disease or sickness, which we've become immune to through our advancements.

","The man called me an angel for what I’d done and a demon for what I was going to do, but I never paid much attention either way. The only thing he did care about was my job at his clinic, a position I’d gotten through sheer willpower and blood-suckling power even if I had no formal education or qualifications. He didn’t like it when someone with a doctorate in molecular biology came into a place where they used things other than a degree as qualifications, especially one that required nothing but a little bit of strength.

It seemed odd, to think all these men were willing to take their last chance from the jaws of death simply for me to extract organs so that these dying people would live just a little longer. In my eyes there wasn’t any difference between giving some poor bastard another week, month, year, or decade of life compared to the few minutes a person typically lived before getting taken down by the sickness eating them from the inside out. A gift is still a gift; regardless whether it’s time given or time that’s stolen. It also helps that people were usually relieved that I was around. No matter how many times you watch your favorite TV show again without paying attention, you will find that you can predict most events, and know more than 90% of what is gonna happen on screen. As far as I was concerned, I was the best damned show ever made; though I have to admit sometimes I forget who the stars really are (though I make sure to name the characters). At this point everyone knows exactly what kind of monster I am, I wouldn’t be surprised to hear “Dexter”, which fits considering my hobbies and preferences, but since it ain’t my real name I don’t answer it. Besides, if there were two different killers running around we couldn’t keep up with the whole thing on television. If people think I’m something good because I took advantage of society’s needs, they need to step back for a second and look at themselves. This doesn’t make them right or wrong, nor is it fair of them to call me a hero because I killed their loved ones for their organs, since they wouldn’t dare kill their families if that was the case: it is morally reprehensible behaviour as well to start demanding those dead bodies, then refusing to feed them when the doctor refuses to give you them? Why not make it simple and say “the sick go to the hospital” and get over yourselves? You think we should all stop being people and become mindless zombies instead so we can harvest your dead family members, so that some rich prick can afford new kidneys every now and again?

For twenty years I have worked here and haven’t killed anyone yet, despite my talents being quite useful to both cops and criminals alike. Now they want to start taking me seriously with no regards for what I tell them? Don’t act too proud of yourself, otherwise you are acting worse than a piglet feeding its own young one while spitting water onto others. That isn’t what good looks like, you see it all the time on tv, but you’re only watching it cause you ain’t got enough respect to stay awake long enough anyway! Goodnight.


""Wait. What?"" asked the nurse standing behind me ""What's the fuck is wrong with him?!"" asked the security guard, whose hair was all messed up and looked dirty and reeky due to whatever chemicals he was injecting into himself during our meeting, but was too busy trying to figure out why the boss called his gun on him so he couldn't ask any clarifying questions.


I slowly walked forward and pointed to the door, saying calmly ""He's fine."" There might be reasons, or there might not be. I know I don't plan on hurting anyone if they try to talk or stand in front of me anymore, and seeing as this particular guy wasn't talking but rather stood there looking dumbfounded, there might be none. I kept walking, but turned around once or twice to see if they were following me, making sure the rest of my body language showed they weren't doing anything stupid.



""Yes... yes it is!"" said the patient from behind us ""But why are you still helping him out? Shouldn't you be getting treated for being a goddamn cannibal?!""

Now, I finally noticed a weird smell coming from his lungs... a mixture of alcohol and ammonia mixed together like shit mixed with piss, somehow managed to convince my mind that I had been drinking my urine for weeks, and judging him based off that conclusion acted accordingly.  As soon as I finished my sentence, I heard the first shot ring through the room from somewhere near the door. Then silence filled the air, aside from the sound of everyone running towards the door after hearing it, except one patient named Steve Miller.



My friend Steven Miller knew I liked the old westerns on television. So naturally he chose that moment to break character.  ""God damn son of a bitch!"", yelled Steve, throwing his cigarette on the floor and running towards the door where I heard him slam against it. ""You didn't even finish my monologue!"" he cried, as if I would actually respond.

The guards did not answer and the prisoners were led out and executed immediately. 


This was the only option for the government as it had become too expensive to sustain them; they could simply keep adding names to a list but there was no way of knowing whether these were real or fake. Therefore the new system provided an official way of eliminating those who they had judged to have killed others (both murders and accidental deaths). The most brutal method available to do this, without getting into serious trouble from the public which tended to see such killings as justifiable, was with a high-powered firing squad. So far the process hadn't been perfect though as some ""non-human"" criminals escaped. These had caused great unrest among citizens who wanted their fellow humans gone to create room in the prisons, especially when two escapes happened at once - one in April and another in November. There was still much outrage but the press kept their mouths shut about it, fearing what the reaction would be from the population if they spoke about what seemed like ""unnatural"" acts happening around every corner. That would also affect the prison economy as more of the public didn't dare take risks anymore, hence less money going to the guards and lesser funding for more resources needed, such as hospitals, etc., thus affecting everyone. Even worse, rumours spread through the streets, claiming that the prisoners' families weren't the real victims after all; in fact, the government was systematically killing off any living relatives instead. This meant no survivors who could testify to whatever crimes the deceased committed, leading everyone to assume their bodies were being disposed of as cheaply as possible. The result has been protests, riots and panic.

It appeared the solution was simple: put the surviving relatives first on the list. Everyone can now say that someone is dead because he deserved it to happen. It should resolve everything then... but not really. At least that was what everyone thought until it became known that each citizen receives an assigned life-time prison sentence in place of execution for crimes they haven't committed.

","I look up from what I thought was a nice glass of Merlot.

“Oh yeah? How would you know anything about that?”  I asked. 

Alec stares back at me, his face barely moving in its entirety except for his mouth, opening a tiny bit.

“The man-in-the-suit had motion capture in it. This doesn’t.” He pointed to the photo frame displaying the movie set, behind me. ""It's pure CGI.""

""No, it's still great, dude.""   My shoulders start to slump.  What do you expect an average guy to do when they find out their greatest work has all been done with some fancy computer program instead of people in suits acting like aliens?""

Alec's eyes widen just slightly as he leans into me and closes in very rapidly.  I turn away so as not to let the movement scare me.

""I have no time for this, don't you see? All those aliens on TV aren't real! If there are any aliens out there they will probably get lost if a camera can record them and we aren't going to be there to make sure they get home!""

He turns back to me. My heart drops to my stomach. His eyes are now locked with mine, holding me within the range where he could strangle me without having to lift a finger. What the hell does he want?!""

""Listen, if you're not going to act then let me."" I say.  There is something oddly comforting in Alec's gaze, perhaps even soothing... but why isn't he doing anything else to talk?  Is he trying to intimidate me by refusing to talk, is that right? No, because he started to speak when things became physical. Then again maybe not. Either way I haven't ever been good at reading his emotions.


He seems close enough to grab me by the throat. That makes sense, I guess..  A rough hand falls on my shoulder gently nudging me away from him.


""Leave or stay I don't care but whatever you choose better be fast.""

Well, it didn't sound bad at first. More than half the people watching me wouldn't mind getting strangled before anyone saw blood (as long as I wasn't the one they chocked). But the thing is, it took me a few days but eventually I realised that my body went numb. And since I never recovered I became completely paralyzed.

","“This was a great movie”

“What?” I asked, confused as to why he would say something like that when we were both sitting in our home theater room sipping glasses of red wine. “I thought it wasn’t good enough”

“Not enough? It was so much better then some bullshit you did last year”

Alec got up from the couch where he’d been sitting and walked over to the fireplace behind the television, picking up two glowing jars. One was filled with little balls covered in paint which looked sort of normal until one by one they glowed and started to swirl around like a hurricane before settling back down into a ball again and being ejected out the window; each one followed a different trajectory. The second jar contained a few rocks and when Alec picked up an illuminated rock to demonstrate what effect they had on a small object suspended above his hand the little object immediately jumped about 2 feet away from him before dropping onto the floor. He placed the rest in a glass box with nothing in them and held it up to me to see if anything glowed but didn’t hear the sound or the rush as a small cluster of colorful sparks shot out of the bottom of the lid.

When the jar exploded in an attempt to create some kind of special effect he quickly tried to extinguish the fire but instead ended up just pushing the light through some cardboard and metal scraps that lit from below due to its proximity to a faulty outlet. It left him standing next to the smoking embers wondering what would happen if he touched the light that was now flickering and pulsating rapidly towards him while another couple of multicolored rocks began floating around the room.  He felt helpless to stop the rapid acceleration of his destruction without killing me first. “Damn this thing is dangerous,” he breathed as his face contorted.

That night went well for Alec. As time progressed, his life changed for the positive. From being able to build more elaborate projects than the ones his family members could dream of he built himself one-way tickets out of space after successfully getting permission to join NASA in engineering. His wife died shortly after due to stress, and eventually, only Alec remained of all their friends and family. After taking his own life there was not much else that mattered except the need for self preservation and finding a new goal for his anger. All was going well until the final stage was reached where he wanted only the impossible to be achieved, and even though he knew nothing other than Earth was possible he still set his goals high. This ultimately led to his death as no single person can exist alone forever, particularly someone obsessed over space travel, who doesn’t realize that Earth has become his best chance of success.

","The first Alien Invaders was released in 2017.  It did well enough to be considered a cult hit. I knew there wasn't much more of an audience out there for our type of sci-fi and horror but we had a bit of fun along the way.

It became popular through word of mouth, after all, what's better than watching aliens walk, talk and move their arms like they were humans who'd been poorly cast? And those costumes! I even ended up making them myself and sold several copies off of Etsy. The special effects looked cheap by today's standards but that's not really how it came across then, is it? Not so much when most sci-fi films from that period have little hope of getting anything better. We managed a decent budget for post production which helped too but without it, everything would have been so incredibly bland looking compared to the competition.

Second alien invasion made a lot of money for both me and my friends thanks to some smart decisions in the writing department, but unfortunately, no one else saw that and just said ""Hey! A lot of people like this."" They didn't see the appeal beyond mindless entertainment and while it did do alright, it only lasted about 6 years. It got less popular due to changing tastes and all sorts of reasons like the fact that our main cast had died and the movie could never quite catch any of us up again.

We moved onto video games soon after which worked wonders for business but we decided to do another film for the love of filmmaking rather than cash. Third film did okay at the box office and went on to be a successful series but again, few gave a damn in retrospect.

One morning, two weeks ago when all three of our leads were busy touring the set of an action movie based on their lives in middle school, Alex suggested something similar. His idea was essentially an indie thriller in a haunted museum which has led him to suggest using the same style as before except with real actors. It seemed absurdly simple. If none of our friends wanted to do it and he wasn't interested either, we wouldn't make the project.

The next morning, someone texted us all about Alex's suggestion, mentioning they found a website with information of everyone who wished they were in their place and that these individuals had gotten exactly that. Some unknown entity in the internet world had put together an ambitious (and insane) plan to bring back 5 old people into bodies of young ones to allow them revenge against the people who wronged them all those years ago.

""They want to come home...,"" he added near the end, ""...not as themselves, but as their younger selves"". I chuckled at the ridiculousness of it until it dawned on me why they thought that. The roles of Mike, the leader in the original story, as being a teenager now and the role of Michael, Alex's character, as the boy who betrayed Mike.

There was nothing worse than losing control over your body. Especially now I know this stuff is happening all around us - there are thousands upon thousands online whose brains were taken out and given new hosts, many never noticing or wanting recognition until their own minds tried to take their memories with them and leave them behind. That guy on the news last week lost his memory after having it wiped and couldn't drive his car anywhere because he forgot where he parked it.

[removed]","""What were those words again, mom?""

I rubbed mine eyes open and looked at the window as though it were calling me. I was now officially awake. 

The sun streamed through the glass shining across my cheekbones and leaving no room to hide from its light, but that didn't bother me much anymore now that I knew what awaited me beyond this white rectangle. I had gotten used to being able to read whatever i wanted at any given time without moving or opening the curtains - my mother told me once she learned how and where to find these portals as a kid, so I tried too. Now, i could use them wherever i want! A world within her mind, just like mine. 

I jumped out of bed and made sure the blanket would stay off the floor for when I moved around the house - the hardwood was still a little bit cold on bare feet, even at half past six. When i got to the kitchen i could hear voices coming from behind the sliding door. My first instinct was anger, then curiosity. Did someone else see me enter our shared space in the early hours of the morning? I waited silently under the counter while they spoke - if i wasn't mistaken, there must have been some type of family dinner since it smelled like bacon instead of eggs, usually mom always gave me some for breakfast before sending me to school. Today, however, it was not only food i was waiting for... but also a pair of legs in matching pajamas, probably coming towards me as fast as their minds could allow! This was definitely going to be a good day!



My mom came forward with a plate full of pancakes and eggs and took care to make the pancake batter look perfect for a picture to post on instagram, the perfect balance of whipped cream and syrup dripping over them - something i secretly admired her for. She asked me, laughing: ""Don't go running around before we eat, princess.""  She pointed to the mirror by which i stared back at myself, my hair slightly tangled and unkept, and said: ""Go get dressed quickly and then join us!"" 


And i did, because mommy loves me. It doesn't really matter why, but i guess all moms are crazy and i am nothing more than an experiment, but all mothers are right! No matter my age.




Once i got dressed in my favorite red dress and put on my purple heels (because of course i wore shoes!) my mom stood behind me taking pictures. She didn't need permission from me since i know where i could change clothes, but it wouldn't hurt to ask, i thought. ""Mommy please stop, now!"" i called her, rolling my eyes - but it worked. She ran out of pictures and grabbed my hand as soon as she saw the front door. We kissed eachother on each side as well - i couldn't decide who needed a hug more: me or her - maybe both!

We drove to the supermarket together, where i already picked out everything i could possibly take: candy, chips, drinks and pizza, among many other things. For a brief moment during shopping, i forgot about him, the boy sitting next to me at school; he seemed nice enough and maybe we can talk and become friends... But that seemed very far away right now. I could practically smell the warm fries and greasy chicken nuggets that accompanied the soda on the way back home.





At first, i hated him. The name, his accent and most of all his stupid outfit weren't appealing whatsoever. Who dresses like *that*? Why is there pink fabric covering every inch of his clothing and sneakers?! At first it looked like glitter glue had spilled over it but i quickly learned it was just paint. He looked like someone painted a rainbow on his clothes. And that color combination was simply awful...



Maybe i was being prejudiced since i wasn't that attracted to women until i met him. I didn't understand my feelings toward him, i liked his style, his humor and his taste for life. I liked how relaxed and happy he always was and i think it was because the whole time i was staring at him from afar, his friends were always making fun of his clothing choice and everyone agreed on this. They just wanted to have some people to laugh at whenever another one of them fell on their butts on a skate board or tripped over something. Their laughter didn't bother me that much, although some times i wished they hadn't laughed. It made me look worse than usual and hurt my cheeks.



But today wasn't a bad day. Nobody laughed at him today. Maybe because the whole thing was new to them, or because he actually changed his appearance. Well it would have taken him 30-45 minutes to paint his entire body, so no, i bet they were shocked and flattered when they finally saw him naked. Or maybe he just decided not to paint anymore! Whatever, it's cool with me anyway!



After some time, my mom went upstairs again, i don't remember her reasoning since nobody was home, but hey, at least i heard her yelling at my father to hurry up! I waited on the floor looking at my phone reading news from several different websites - i loved doing that while i waited for Mommy. Her voice grew louder and closer, slowly approaching me and the faint scent of frying onions filled the air, leading to my hungry stomach rumbling happily... I finally spotted her again, holding a spatula covered in oil and flour.

""There,"" she shouted from behind the curtain, ""you can go eat now, honey.""

""Yes, mommy, thanks!"", i replied calmly hiding the jealousy.

""We have egg-heads on the loose?"" asked one resident who ran into his next-door neighbor.

No, said that man who was sitting outside of his own front porch, looking over at all the people gathering outside of his window. ""Just an egg-splosions,"" he shouted out. ""Everyone is going bananas!""


Then again, it wasnt crazy what had happened so far:

* You woke up one morning to the delicious smell of bacon sizzling on an old griddle. There, in your doorway sat an attractive woman, she looked like something from television or perhaps the movies or comics. 

The woman had long hair, dark as raven feathers (and even longer than her dress), brown eyes staring down at you with a smile on her lips as she handed you the bag of bacon. She smiled and began talking: ""It's strange how life works but anyway, I came across your name through the address book on a phone booth. When I thought about your name I felt an urge so strong it told me I should visit - the craving led me straight here."" The woman paused for a second, glancing at each door of you neighbors houses before returning to you, saying, ""I hope you know what they look for, they always eat bacon first because their greed compels them! I don't want any casualties though just some nice company and I think we could be quite fun together...so tell me what time did you graduate highschool? What are you studying now? And how many brothers/sisters do you have?""

And the questions go on and on.

She didn't mention anything about why she breaks into peoples homes but then again why would she. It has been a while since she learned the consequences; besides after several months of living like this there has never been an incident where nothing remains behind but an empty bowl of cereal.



Now, back at my local news station in the middle of a live broadcast we found ourselves reporting on a story where no egg was left without it's shell. A beautiful woman in a black dress was found ransacking a local diner causing a huge fuss amongst the guests and police alike. Some claiming she tried to pull a fast one by running into the bank only to run away once the teller started questioning her motives, others stating that she wasn't a stranger at all, and most telling that if anyone knows this person then let us know - which might be easy considering half of New York city is watching. After a few hours another message appeared on our website and we weren't wrong: someone contacted us with a tip pointing to school kids being targeted. We went to the site immediately to investigate and what we saw left many speechless. These were definitely not high schoolers, these kids could easily pass off as 2nd or even 3rd graders. Then suddenly the school board announced that due to recent events they wouldn't return after Easter break. They promised to call us upon further developments.


There were rumors swirling around every corner. People were afraid of leaving their doors unlocked. Parents were keeping tabs on their kids when stepping outside and teenagers were forced to lock themselves inside their rooms at night. Even college students were on edge; you couldnt find a place without having seen such incidents unfold right under the noses of adults. For the first time we managed to contact another network with this breaking news. Our colleagues managed to catch her red-handed again at the grocery store, this time purchasing eggs instead of bacon which made it seem like it couldn't be true but the sight of her pushing through an aisle full of terrified customers before grabbing 100 cartons of eggs made us realize this whole situation seemed more sinister than just an angry housewife playing patty cake with stray chickens and babies.

There is something about the way she acts that makes you want to get closer but knowing better, but her charm is what always keeps me coming back for more.

It began when a strange aroma reached my nostrils one morning. Not the smell of bacon but it smelled like breakfast and the source felt wrong on purpose so I walked outside. 

The air behind the house where the scent originated was oddly warm even in September and as I peered down the dark hill I came across the figure sitting near the fence. A white woman stood alone at the bottom watching birds from a tree while waiting for food to come to her.

As if sensing my presence and turning around she made eye contact with me causing a cold shiver down my spine. It was not fear as an old childhood nickname often triggered that response which left me smiling until my teeth hurt then shivering uncontrollably, No this was... different. Her eyes were black and unworldly reflecting all emotion without any actual expression to match them but there wasn't anger or malice to see either just vacant awareness. She tilted her head slightly and gestured towards the table set in front of the house. A blanket covered its surface where coffee, fruit and pastry awaited me.

Intrigued I sat on the step before crossing the porch and approaching the table. I took a look around to make sure no one else could see me before sliding myself onto the chair. The woman didn't seem bothered though as she started eating from her own plate, carefully pouring small bits of various fruits and pastries into miniature bowls before devouring the rest of them whole with ease.

She looked very much an artist and almost like an angel or an extraterrestrial alien perhaps... I couldn't tell.  Before she spoke she glanced up and smiled in a friendly and reassuringly charming manner.

""So...we really shouldn't be here?""

He sighed deeply and stood up. ""You mean, that our god should not be angry right now? If you didn't know better it seems strange, but we must try."" 

He moved over to a table covered by red and black cloth in the back of the store, where lay several scrolls, papers on different surfaces stacked high like a pyramid with ancient Hebrew writing. The first parchment, made of aged papyrus was still unreadable even with a great light. His eyes darted from one to another, searching for something special. He stopped when they fell upon parchment three, a beautiful picture of something unknown at hand. It seemed more recent then all others but also very clean. There were two figures, both clothed in white robes kneeling before a square shape; a rectangle with four legs and an open door, perhaps a doorway. Above them stood three other figures of lesser stature, hooded and looking down. A wave of warmth rushed into him despite how cold it was. He grabbed up parchment number four, which contained no writing, yet had been touched by magic: it felt oddly warm and inviting. He read the symbols quickly before placing it safely in the chest next to his desk, behind which a small shrine existed with a single candle burning low. Then taking the cover off the pyramid he gently laid it flat, carefully pulling out the old scroll.  

A little later, after reading a few lines, his wife came by: she saw what he was doing.

""What are you reading?""

He looked up sharply - as always she could tell he had just been speaking to gods- or aliens. 

""Nothing, dear. Nothing. I do hope you won't think I haven't heard any of your chatter today, though. Perhaps I can help. Would you make me tea?"" She replied curtly without further comment. He smiled sadly and walked away. They had been having rough times recently, his job had been unstable and most of their children had gone. Yet somehow the stress had never truly gotten to her, only him. She took a book off the shelf beside it to take to the study, while he went to cook and brew. It wasn't often his love for his faith came home with him these days, so perhaps this might be enough to keep it alive until it gave him some peace. As he poured tea from the pot, the priest put a finger to his lips, silencing the girl who now played under the banisters as she watched him work. After a few minutes, she began to cry.  Their son would soon join the church as well; he couldn't resist telling the little boy of God, he knew the stories his father told weren't true, but his daughters already swore allegiance to the holy ones as their father had taken many steps to show them such devotion, showing them signs, speaking of heavenly events. This girl, he thought fondly of the child of the angels, perhaps she did too believe. She took the pot of tea and came upstairs to sit on the couch downstairs, offering the tea again. The priest set down his quill and drank in silent thanks, he needed this, he realized he had done wrong, far too much wrong. His life had become less religious recently, or rather the people around him had been more religious. He hadn't missed the last communion, hadn't asked if his daughter liked Jesus either. His sons hated being called by that name, his granddaughters worshipped him in their own strange ways. For his failure, he prayed to the one God most likely offended.

This little thing, this person who exists, whom is called Michael, doesn't understand what he does. He doesn't know how to work here. When he went around the world, all the people were screaming and running to protect themselves from him.  Nobody believed them when they said he was killing their family members. Nobody trusted anyone at all because of his influence. Not even Jesus or Mohammed.

The time came where Michael himself decided he was alone and needed to learn what kind of magic had corrupted this place. So he walked in this tiny village and saw old women who only wanted to give birth but couldn't find a man. A girl was crying over her missing brother; she cried about how he wasn't good, unlike other children. Michael asked her parents if he knew them before that boy left town and all the family members just looked at each other without saying anything. That night Michael told them he'll return to solve his problem with his magic. 

Two days later Michael returned. This time he brought two men with him - one man taller than the other.  Michael used his eyes to look towards the horizon and point west to the woman weeping over her lost son while smiling at him, ""You see the village she lives in? She's been here ten years now with nothing to show for it except grief."" It was clear which woman he pointed to. ""Yes!"" shouted Michael. The tall boy ran off in search of the woman so Michael gave instructions to use his eye again and showed him where to find them. Michael stayed in the city as the men searched the area.


A year later after returning to this village with a pair of friends Michael found himself walking along this small road where he met these strangers who weren't wearing clothes. One of them looked at him and laughed pointing toward the opposite side of the country, ""You came back,"" it said looking into his face, ""He's waiting for you"".

He leaves without an attempt or exchange. There is no hesitation in his face as he exits. It is not like she knew him but her family knows. She smiles as tears come down her cheeks. The only good thing that happens with being in hiding for so long is knowing something truly good will take time before it returns...or never comes back at all. At one point it had felt different. If anything had happened it should have involved betrayal since their first meeting was not very friendly nor romantic, she would make sure her name was never seen among those who stood against her again either for better or for worse. But now things are just normal. Normal means that there is nothing more for anyone to do except mourn after their demise. Or to continue with what they had done. That was exactly what her father did.



She looks over to see that both men on either side were gone. One moment they were standing between her room and entrance. Now they had vanished leaving two empty doors behind. And then it dawns upon her - how she feels relieved. Relieved that she could leave this place while still feeling safe from another murder. Relief that she wasn't facing the consequences of being innocent despite the evidence pointing otherwise for years. No she didn't feel fear any longer. No longer because death wasn't as appealing anymore as when she was being chased around her home. This time the man wasn't looking to kill but to protect. He didn't know what she felt, maybe he really couldn't feel. She smiled and said goodbye to him, turning away for the last time. With relief running through her veins, she made herself known outside the house as usual. A familiar blue eyes looked towards her asking ""Why would I hurt the best protector we ever had?""

[removed]","In a small forest, surrounded by the trees that have witnessed all manner of human acts of depravity in their lifetimes, there lived one very rare and unusual creature: A canine who, having inherited its ancestors’ talents and traits - including blood-thirst - had grown to be the world’s most renowned serial killer.

For many centuries, he was only a rumour; the tales passed down from generation to generation through stories of people seeing a black poodle with unusually large jaws that would wander through their towns, and stalk nearby houses in search of their owners’ pets; or perhaps children playing unattended in parks. It wasn’t until 1986, when this phantom reappeared, making his claim for recognition in society as a serial killer once more, but this time, he did not roam free. He walked through town with a pair of brown boots strapped on both feet, sat amongst a crowd outside an abandoned house where dogs were frequently sold off to customers, before being handed over to strangers and vanishing without a trace – all while carrying around a pair of long tongs with no discernible purpose, aside from their sharp edges being able to cut through leather like butter. No human has been touched yet… so far. His next victim awaits at one of the local slaughterhouses, waiting to become the latest member of his growing legion of souls within the spirit world…

No matter where you go around this town, you'll find him standing outside his door with an offer to take down any stray animal near by if they just lay down right there before he walks over. You dont even have time to react before your head is falling backwards against the brick wall and all of his bullets are already in you.

[removed]","You couldn’t figure how it happened: I, *Rex*, a purebred German Shepherd, and the #1 dog in the canine crime database for my entire life, had gone mad.

It started out easy enough, killing the neighbor’s chihuahua who was always up in his business, barking at Rex every 5 minutes even though he was half deaf, biting me in his own backyard (which was basically his property), or just generally trying to be aggressive towards me while ignoring Rex when he was eating or sleeping. However, as time went by, things got worse. A squirrel that was stealing treats from my bowl! It must have been an enemy of Rex’s cause why else would it steal food? How dare he try to steal from his favorite toy buddy! Next thing I know, some children were playing around him…he growled in aggression, nipped one of their hands, scaring them away but not letting loose any bite marks and licking his nose to clean his fangs before burying himself in his bed until his master came into the room with dinner. He just could not be bothered anymore and gave me only an empty, empty stare for the rest of dinner. 

I knew there was no going back after all this; however, the fact I didn’t actually kill anyone was too hard to give up. The urge lingered, like pulling teeth, growing stronger as more times passed. Now every single animal within Rex’s home began to become targets. I saw how he treated everyone with such blatant hatred that everything felt pointless and meaningless.

Finally, one night at around 3 AM, I took matters into my own paws. I jumped up onto the counters and reached the refrigerator behind the other fridge where the milk bottles rested against the wall. One of these bottles fell off its shelf due to me jumping on the counter and landed directly into the sink making a very large splash. At least Rex didn’t look down for a minute because I grabbed the nearest bottle and pulled its rubber seal open using my little teeth. Once I broke free from the neck loop holding its cap I ripped open the container and drank all the contents right into my mouth. Then and only then did Rex finally turn his head. He watched me chug the milk down right from the bottom of the bottle, wondering what sort of evil demon I might do with that huge amount of water. But the biggest mystery of all seemed quite literally on Rex’s face when I stopped drinking, standing upright on my four legs again looking down with disappointment at the remaining milk bottle stuck to my tongue instead of being a clear sign of obedience and fear as usual.

“What does he want?” thought Rex desperately running towards me. “He looked so hungry but hasn’t asked if I would leave him alone…that wasn’t exactly polite!” Rex looked left and right for someone to tell him what’s happening, but nobody appeared nearby; perhaps they’ve fled to find somewhere to hide now? Maybe something terrifying lurks outside! This isn’t working out. Something’s gotta happen soon…something. Suddenly, through that window over there, Rex heard something clink! And a strange voice asking about Rex’s plan.

""What do you mean kill you?"" I asked, still bewildered by the demand of my dogmaster. 

The man seemed to look right through me. ""Don't pretend you don't understand what I mean.""

How could he not understand? Did he think we were two different species or something? That this wasn't obvious? After a long moment I shook my head. ""No one has ever called for us to die before... so I can understand why that would be an odd request but..."" I pointed with my pointer toe towards the floor. ""This thing is out of bounds."" 

""Well someone put these things here because they are unsafe. So let someone take them out of there."" The man said flatly. It took a while for me to understand him but he did seem concerned when he realized I needed a moment. Eventually I ran my snout across the ground. With a sniff at each tile I tried to find where they all were going - under, outside, around. Nothing new came up.

They were surrounded by several armed robots now: all looking straight ahead with laser guns aimed at them and their tiny little bodies locked down to their chairs strapped into metal tubes. These were new toys for a new human.

The female had a few friends with her; she looked back to see that the two others sitting next to her weren't going very well. One of them has lost some skin, maybe from being knocked out and then having some of it removed. The other is holding his head trying not to scream. That's right - they are in the interrogation center after failing a polygraph test and losing most of your memories. And no one told them why!

""Well,"" said the robotic voice again, while the technicians came closer, slowly but surely closing the door behind them. It got lower too, so those who tried to look around could only hear more than see more.

The robot took an action that seemed natural to it - as if something deep inside it remembered what was happening and what was supposed to happen. Its hand slid open and pointed its finger towards their hearts while its eye opened and showed nothing but blue fire while the rest of its body still stared straight ahead. What was supposed to happen now began almost silently - one woman coughed lightly and another just woke up, breathing fast. Their eyes met, then focused on whatever was now standing in front of them. A small humanoid figure, wearing a dark suit and shining armor which shone with golden light. It knelt low before them as it pointed its finger onto their chests and spoke to them calmly and soothingly.

(This has been a work of fiction. Do you know someone else named Elizabeth?)

(Also it is always good to be safe...)

When we meet at the corner store, she would always hold my gaze longer than anyone else (almost as long as her husband, whose face I sometimes wondered where it went since the last time I saw it). When I would leave the store, she would stand there watching me walk away until I completely walked past, then wave me off like I didn’t even exist. Then go about buying something to eat. Her hair seemed dull today, I think she hadn’t washed it recently or something. No telling when it might be the last time I ever saw her, but her expression made no distinction between us - not really seeing me in any case and certainly not seeing *me* at least.

Yesterday was her first day working security. Two years ago I found her job application scrunched into a box full of old cereal boxes, wedged under our neighbors trashcans. If I remember correctly, she moved here less than four months prior. Maybe if I ask her neighbor sometime, he knows more or less, or I can make assumptions based on his attitude. He has always reminded me of my uncle Frank - same kind of greasy white-haired guy who smells heavily of tobacco. So he should know a thing or two about people. But maybe there’s a better way, maybe ask the mail carrier? Seems pretty obvious though.

They say people don’t want to die anymore unless they hate the living because the things they used to do seem insignificant when life goes on without them but what is death but the end of the line to everything?

I need coffee, coffee can solve many problems but most of them never get solved anyway so that only adds up to another cup, a second mug just sits on top of the counter unfulfilled. Maybe there is nothing to drink after all so why start pouring it all into this cup filled mostly empty? Or even better maybe there actually IS enough to fill it to overflowing and I am going to get sick later tonight because of overcaffeination. This could be bad if I lose my apartment if I miss the last payment. Then I won’t get another one anytime soon either since they will probably assume I am irresponsible. Should I try to call him anyways, yes I guess so. Maybe it’s already late? Fuck it. I wonder why the hell am I doing this?

She moves to the kitchen and pours herself another cup. I walk over there to find it empty. My heart skips. Oh fuck NO. Just as I turn around to look toward the bedroom doorway to yell hello to her, I trip on the floor, rolling forwards to come to a stop beneath my couch. What the HELL?!?! That wasn’t an accident. Who put a bottle cap on that sharp edge?! Shit shit SHIT!! Why didn’t I look at the damn wall before walking across this damn carpet! It started to hurt real bad as I hit that table leg against the tile countertop and rolled up to take a seat and collapse. There is a lot of pain now. Tears starting prickling and running down my face, I feel nauseous and weak. Everything is blurry now. Too much shit is happening to understand but I just hope she is okay.

","It was a stupid trick. All it did was tell you exactly what time your life was going to end in minutes.

But it didn’t really start till she used it for the first time when there were less than 2 seconds left on her clock. When all of her friends gathered around her as they thought she was joking, because the numbers had always stayed the same until right at death, so how could that be possible? But no one wanted to believe the words she said. She gave them hell afterall, but everyone still cared about her. Her friend group was the only family she has left, after having turned them into her closest confidants while losing the only person who actually loved her for real - The one with the red roses in his collar. You see, he had given her her greatest gift before she died, an apple watch. She never got out of bed more than a few feet from him though, always sat with her fingers crossed watching a TV show every day. Every single hour. He would walk over just like any other time, give her his most handsome grin ever seen by the sun itself (it was quite rare seeing as he never smiled when others were around), and kiss her hand. And now that it happened more often then not, he’d been sleeping next to her the past few weeks instead of being curled up on her sofa under the couch cushions. He wasn’t sure if it was the best thing in the world or just another way to make me happy. Whatever the reason may have been, I never saw him again.

All that night I lay down by my phone, reading and calling old friends i forgot names of. Looking back now I wonder if i should have picked up on this sooner. I guess i just assumed that i wasn't missing anything or that maybe it had slipped my mind. No big deal i told myself. Just go to sleep for five more minutes and check my watch again tomorrow, that seemed like a fair trade off. Not enough people think of suicide if you just get rid of their worst nightmare. It made it seem like nothing too special anymore and that maybe i deserved some kind of punishment for what i had done. That was probably why i waited until the last minute. Maybe it was guilt or regret, or maybe i just really hated waiting, but either way i made it happen. The Apple Watch flashed me back to reality, its white face glowing brightly compared to my bedroom’s dim lights. There were plenty of clocks hanging above the mantle fireplace where dad placed a new clock to replace the broken grandfather one we recently lost. Time went backwards though as i glanced closer, noticing it was still stuck around 12:00. At least i got the surprise of a lifetime, i can say. A couple years later my mom decided it was time to sell our house now that i wasn’t living there anymore. Dad died peacefully in bed during the night without warning. I couldn’t bring myself to find it in me to feel joy over his passing, just numbness and regret at not finding him alive somewhere else. Everything looked completely different in mourning, i felt more numb with each photo album flipped through. Mom sold the watch quickly and bought some sort of robot vacuum cleaner (what could go wrong). As far as she was concerned that solved everything. We are together once again, with nobody dead except for mine father. They lived long lives and spent their entire adult lives together. What could have gone better right? So i guess this is it. One last time, let’s set the record straight with a bunch of letters to her name.

She gave us one good twenty something year relationship, even though it took nearly two months to learn i was sick. Now that both of them are dead she tells me the truth. With some small twist and a very expensive device she came across on ebay that helped her discover how fast i moved away from home. After all these years i finally figure it out and realize that the only secret she kept was how far away i really am, not whether i was gay. Though i hope she had found someone better than the woman with curly hair, skinny build, blonde hair, green eyes, big lips, and piercing blue eyes i had loved since she broke my heart seven goddamn months ago. That idiot knew i was looking at her and gave me the cold shoulder for four years and all of sudden breaks my heart... AGAIN! I mean come on man, don't treat me like shit, i liked you even though i know i shouldn't, i loved you so much for you to want to spend forty minutes with me? For the last ten years she dated three girls before coming home to live with me? Is she still playing games and trying to break my fucking heart?! Come on dude..  I know i said i wouldn't play those stupid little games anymore but damn it... i have to protect myself from the pain.

Anyway, i haven't forgotten. Even though i almost died, and all of the wonderful surprises we had gotten used to, i still had the luxury of figuring out the true ending.

I gasped and stood up instantly, grabbing the knife sitting beside me. I frantically searched for the bathroom mirror and held my body up to see. My reflection looked paler than usual. Then, I saw my reflection smile. I realized that I had done the unthinkable to gain immortality. 

""That doesn't work"" my reflection muttered, turning slightly grey. It shook its head slowly.

I tried not to panic. It usually comes to me at random times and stays for a few moments. Usually, I use that time to distract myself by thinking of other ways that my plans failed. Or something like that. This time I don't know what to do, though. This doesn't make sense, I didn't kill my sister, I just cut off my arm. Why isn't that working? Oh well. What will help me now?

No matter how long we’d been together he never asked to marry me because there were girls that would give him that special ring (he told me once) but nobody ever truly loved him like I did because I had actually seen something in him that people couldn’t see. Nobody saw his soul though and he ended up choosing Emily because she had the same kind of look. Some superficial bullshit! She just looked prettier to him and I’m sure she was a lot nicer to boot. The fact that I was able to stay quiet and let him go for a whole year without saying anything shows what a great person I was, right?

It's an overwhelming feeling knowing that your child needs you for the rest of their life, but at the same time its liberating because they need you so desperately. A little bit selfish too to be honest, if the child has anything bad happen to them in the future, its my fault. That just means I will never grow old, and die from natural causes when the day finally comes. My daughter is beautiful, so it's okay to feel greedy that she hasn't given me any grandchildren yet.

I work as a pilot for NASA out in space, traveling around the galaxy exploring stars and planets.  When my job was first offered I declined it after learning about what happened to our last guy, who stayed longer than he should have and was killed by the radiation outside. But my wife convinced me to take it. When we met two years ago I didn't think it would ever lead us together, but it did. My biggest reason for wanting to stay with her is because no matter how much time passes or however many years pass between visits, we always meet up in heaven.

My family lives on earth, I know my wife and children don't even care about my career anymore but I keep doing it because it allows me to visit my family occasionally.  They love going to see me travel around the galaxy. In return I am given gifts, presents, and all kinds of other goodies. And sometimes they fly back down to Earth, visiting myself and his parents for vacation!

It might sound lonely to some, being able to go back to where they were born every few days is pretty common when it comes to astronauts. Though it can get hard seeing the world change for so long, and then coming back to see how everything stayed the same.

You were surrounded by a white floor, and even closer than that, countless white angels hovering in perfect formation. They reached down to grab onto your shirt, but they kept falling back into their place. This had been going on for days! Each one seemed willing to die as much as me if I wanted to join them - but each time I had just punched them flat onto the floor without giving up my space. The end of the line was a dark blue line. After all this suffering there was nothing at the end other than empty darkness. 

You slowly walked forward till you reach that point where you are able to feel all those poor angels falling down again and again.

He tried to jump down onto the soft bed that was spread across from him in front. It was thin and made of what felt like plastic. How long has he been here anyway? 3 hours? He stood up, not sure if he should be standing when there were things around him but they seemed to hold him. He reached for the door and pushed at it. It opened, showing the two other cells beyond. In each of the 4 rooms, he saw people sitting, laughing as though playing games or reading.

He went past the two doors that led outward to check how far along these hallways were. At each turn another hallway opened into another room until he arrived at the main hall; a massive white empty chamber filled with hundreds of those same beds... 507128396 individual spaces... One particular bed caught his eye because of an angel's wings that adorned it.

","We had gone to war a thousand years ago. I was the general at the time, my greatest opponent wasn't some demon lord or god of chaos, but rather a being so powerful it was almost inconceivable. It had been able to destroy an army from earth, and leave millions of us dead in its wake. At that moment in time, we weren't sure what we were fighting against, if anything, or where we could find sanctuary.

As our planet died, humanity sought refuge in space, eventually ending up on a distant galaxy, still under threat of annihilation as their planet also succumbed to the enemy. There they created their new religion, called ""Heaven"". They believe their place is heaven. We didn't see the point of believing that. The only way people could escape the hell they built for themselves after committing terrible acts. Their supposed paradise became less of a haven than a prison for souls who wanted nothing more than peace and happiness. 

This has become much more evident recently, because Hell isn't hell anymore. For starters, their soldiers don't have any guns! Instead they can throw blades imbued with souls, which are nearly indestructible when held correctly, into your heart until you die. These ""blessed"" can enter Heaven easily (in that same fashion as how someone can be sent to hell), as long as they can convince them to let them in without trying to fight. And if they fight? No problem: he will send them back down! It takes centuries to even reach heaven, so if there ever is an Earth again after this damn apocalypse, it won't be long before everyone is on its ground once again. But just when it seems like it's safe, these blessed begin fighting, instead of fleeing from heaven/hell. They're getting desperate. What does that tell you about human nature?

The fact is we've learned nothing from all those years ago. That one event was the turning point... not only in humanity's history, but our entire existence. We never should have done what we did; we couldn't fathom why, yet here we are now and no one knows.

I tied him to a tree upside down and then left without a word before anybody came along to arrest me. By the time people figured what happened, no evidence remained except for two bloody wounds on his forehead, one barely noticeable if one wasn't looking closely at them. There were countless hours spent trying to find his cellmate but we couldn't find anything, no trace of who put you where and why. So I returned a few years later when I was released and told the authorities exactly what happened. For some reason I have done nothing wrong since that day, maybe because of how little anyone else has experienced what truly happens in hell. Maybe only god knows for sure. He does seem like the kind of god that likes giving us problems now and again, though. Especially as far as finding all the information he wanted quickly so easily. 


You are wondering, just why am I in hell? I don't know. A random incident. Not even an accident. The last thing I remember about that car wreck was screaming the name, Emily. In the darkness I hear whispers telling me she isn't dead yet and to tell her that someone loves her. Something like that. At first I didn't understand, then I realized none of these messages make any sense. God can create demons. He's also created humans. And animals. But he hasn't managed to create sentience in something less intelligent than a cow. This makes things a bit easier, actually. Humans should be able to decipher this stuff by themselves. What's more important though is that they believe it enough to follow the instructions given through the medium of Satanism. Which is, obviously the same as belief in Christianity. Now the real question is whether or not you believe this message will bring Emily back alive. You see, I got thrown in there because of the rumors of me being involved in crimes punishable by death under the law. Here comes the next sentence: *Spoiler alert* They weren't true.

It doesn’t matter if people know or not; one day your soul will run out and another life awaits me in my place. That’s how long my sentence was supposed to be anyway. It is what it is.

They are different than me. For one there is no “me” for them anymore, but rather someone else completely. Their only identity remains their past and whatever memories the current body holds. But it shouldn’t happen to me. If everything happens according to plan things should be simple. The soul knows nothing, feels nothing, doesn’t care about anything. 30-year-old man? Sure. College student? Ok. A toddler? I thought I did better with that. I do hate infants and children even so why would *that* get sent to hell instead? Whatever; it can suck it right?

First writing prompt submitted, hope it's good!","A shadow appeared on my hand as I reached for another donut while eating breakfast today, a darkness that looked like no hand could be formed from such matterless stuff. What happened next was something out of a horror flick- not sure if it would ever happen in reality but hey... I did kill my grandfather last week. A sudden flash of light later everything around me seemed wrong again; I noticed I had gotten dressed and now stood naked again - though looking in the mirror confirmed I wasn't actually covered in clothes, nor am I fully naked. It is only slightly embarrassing because I *am* looking naked. If this is all a figment of your imagination then please put me out of my misery.

I woke up after what can probably best be described as sleep paralysis in an old mansion, its wallpapered walls and furniture giving off a truly gothic atmosphere as well as feeling slightly cool against my skin; though more so than normal. No sound came from outside of what sounded like someone moving their feet somewhere nearby; I thought it might have been myself at first, being partially human and all, but no sound came from inside either. All in all, most horrifyingly, nothing sounds like anything at all except for the faint hum coming from the large dark pit behind whatever room I'm currently standing in, which happens to be a living hellfire pit full of some demon that's staring right into me with unfathomable hunger. The sight before me takes my breath away, as his eyes bore into mine.

""What are you going to do about me? Do I need to give you a little lesson in fear?"" he asks with a cold voice emanating out of him; I'll admit I did hear a few squeaks, pops, and rumbles from him too, and even found myself jumping slightly when the black shadows moved back a bit further. ""Don't make fun of my form, boy,"" he says with an annoyed huff, ""it took years to cultivate the aura I posses."" I realize now that maybe the noises aren't as clear as they seem to be because I'm wearing my headphones. Taking them off, he speaks with less urgency now: ""Well, look who decided to join us. Come on over here."" After getting rid of my electronics, we approach the black abyss towards us until I trip on something and fall. As soon as I hit the ground, the entire floor disappears and leaves me hanging off the edge of my bed; however, I don't realize what happened because of the lack of shock I experience when falling for a moment (I think). After landing hard down on my bed sheets, the dark pits stare down at me.

""Well, I suppose we couldn't just bring you here and make you stay permanently. Your heart can still beat like everyone else's, meaning you might try to run away!"" I find myself gasping for air as I notice the demon's demonic aura is slowly disappearing now, causing it to take shape into someone who looks vaguely familiar despite having horns. This isn't how it should be! ""Of course! I'd rather not die anyway. You know that I haven't learned the art of killing yet, do you? I'm afraid to learn what you do! Maybe we could practice? With me playing the role of the victim?""

Has God given them life so that one day he might end it? Or even worse, will this be their last goodbye?

He opened his mouth, then he froze, looking up to see her face above him. 

She looked down at him. ""Why?"" she breathed, tears in her eye. But this time it wasn't fear. 

""What do you want?"" Her words were so unexpected that no doubt crossed my mind until the terror and agony crept back into my soul as I looked from her body to hers own hands and then back to her body again. As far as I can remember, nothing is quite like death. She held out her hand for me to take, and I watched as she moved them closer together. 

""Please."" She sobbed, and I reached my arms around her. Even though she died, her soul stayed with mine still. That part of her was free. 

No one would believe us if we said it, but her and I were lovers. We shared each other the most honest things any two people have to say, even when nobody else was listening. In truth, she hadn't really left at all.

We met when she found herself locked in our town prison. When she saw me I had been chained down by police officers. A prisoner accused of kidnapping, murder and rape. Every night the jailers came in to check on us, but none of them cared how it went for us. They never saw beyond the chains. And for that reason, I became a celebrity.

It started off simple enough. The newspaper wrote about every thing I said or did throughout the day and put it in print. People paid attention, and I got more money. My lawyers kept arguing my case and brought in much money. Soon I got enough money where there was something to buy my freedom: I just needed more than money, I need my love for myself and her, and the fact that it worked the moment she touched me. At least until now, when I am dead.

At first he seemed nice enough but there was something very off about him. No one can have truly kind eyes; even if someone tried to fake them no normal person could maintain a perfectly natural expression for so long. But they never looked *too* natural so at any rate they didn't worry me. If they looked too normal I couldn't help but wonder if they might be an inhuman or unnatural being who hid their true self behind those glass blue/green shades of normalcy.

""Well here we are. You look scared..."" this is getting stupid.

""Stop! Please stop!"" I continued struggling but after trying and failing a few times more than usual, I realized I had run out of options. The only way out of his arms was to stop resisting.

""Alright then, let's see what I can do about your little predicament"" he began walking towards the exit when suddenly stopping all motion. That made my jaw twitch which caused him to grab my chin and spin me around until I was facing him. I stood there speechless when he gave me a grin.  He pulled me toward him and kissed me gently and tenderly with tears streaming down my face. When he finally got off I wiped them away and looked into his deep sapphire eyes looking down in shame.

The door swung open to reveal a bright room filled with glowing green crystals which pulsed slowly to life with each passing second as long as I stood here, despite how many times my armor got knocked down the amount of gold that came pouring out of these crystals made up for quite the reward.  My party consisted of me (a warrior), A barbarian (who could kill anything with ease), an archer (he had no problems hitting targets without magic since he was human) and finally a mage (the mage took care of any non-magical enemies.)   We needed a place to rest so we decided this would be good considering the fact that when I walked through the door I received a golden key to access it and it was pretty much like treasure after death or whatever. The door slammed shut again and my entire party looked around confused... What'd we do now?

""*Wheres the exit!?"" yelled my barbarian*

*A deep voice echoed throughout the room ""What?! It was only level 6 dude! Why does everything start getting harder when I teleport?* *Yelled a smallish black box.*

And then the reality came crashing down upon us, something appeared above us that had begun breathing heavily with an evil light emitting from its core and the color brown flowed onto our armor and boots and our swords became jagged metal spiked weapons and our armor glowed red instead of blue. And as we rushed towards the entity that caused this madness my barbarians fist began to gleam white and turn into an axe while the archer's arrows stopped turning and turned black with smoke coming out of them... *You don't want this either*.

It laughed and raised its arms wide ""I am not bound to any level sir. How come my HP is almost full even if all of yours is negative?\

","I wake up every day ready for someone to kill me. And yet, no one does it, so my hope begins to fade

I had left work early and was just driving home when I saw his van pulled over on the side of the road in front of my house (it's an old Victorian like mine).  In the window sat a man sitting by some kind of console, headphones around his neck. He looked bored. That's not what alarmed me though. It was the look of *bored*. Like something boring him. 

Well that's pretty normal isn't it? Some guys are prone to boredom more than others. I went outside curious but also scared to go to this guy after all he did to me and my friends years ago. As soon as I got closer to his car, he looked at me with a look of terror and yelled back to me: 

""GO AWAY!"" I stood right there before him until he seemed calm enough. Then I started to walk around the passenger side to try to get a look under the hood. Something was wrong. He kept yelling at me through his headset telling me to leave but something caught my eye in the way the car turned, it didn't stop in a straight line towards me as its usual intended path did! It veered sharply into a street down the road, almost hitting a wall before stopping. What is it supposed to do now? He wasn't doing anything other than hiding while staring at me. When I walked closer to his car he began shouting curses at me again as though it were nothing to be concerned about. The radio played soft music so I decided to take the opportunity and peek through the window once more.

The scene came at me full speed--the dashboard was lit blue or red, lights flickered, dials flashed numbers, then everything disappeared. His face went slack as though a part of him died and replaced with blankness. In fact he did die sometime ago if you ask any of our friends... he drowned years ago somewhere far away as the body was never found. I noticed blood starting to leak out the front of his head and the blood soaked through whatever plastic case covered it all up. Blood soaked through a piece of cloth and onto his clothes. This could have ended badly for me, since I really thought this guy took the plunge but nope! Just the man laying dead in his own car. I moved closer to see how long it'd take for police to arrive after his car stopped responding to the flashing siren. Not being the quickest guy on foot I would guess it wouldn't be too long before they made their way around here to see what all the fuss was about. So much for another day filled with existential despair, oh well guess we can live another day. I turn around to walk home when I suddenly feel some force behind me and I can no longer see clearly because of tears, blood and mud on my eyes. I finally stand there and fall backward on the pavement trying to make sense of what I'm seeing. There are no cars nearby, the whole area has been destroyed; buildings knocked to the ground, buildings burning like they were being set ablaze by fireworks. The most jarring thing to me was that all the people still running were looking at this sight with wide eyes like they expected it. Oh crap did they survive? Did I fail to save them or just cause everyone else to fail? My legs don't work anymore and I collapse forward onto my knees next to the building I was walking toward.


*beep beep beep beeep*



What happened? Fuck why isn't anyone responding? My hands were clawing at the bloody hole beneath my hands, desperately clawing but unable to find a release point. No it didn't happen again. Someone called the ambulance already. Hopefully they will come in time. But wait shit they shouldn't have done that; They aren't going to help you. What do these goddamn fools think they are doing?! I shout my plea for help but no sound comes out of my mouth. I realize at that moment that I'm standing inside the headspace of whoever lives here now - it hurts to look ahead of you. Everything is red and blurry except for a small rectangle on the left hand side where I remember this strange man staring with hateful eyes at. I stare into the screen at the familiar desktop icon reminding me why I should kill myself, but instead look into my friend's blank white eyes. It seems that his soul was taken out and replaced with a demon's skull which was giving him power. I decide then, then I am glad I survived this day.

---------------------

Lily and i were going to move out of our flat when she invited me to stay with her but because she needed someone to watch her goldfish that night, we split the difference with one nights rent on either side. For the past year or so we have been having a strange sort of relationship with each other, like an intense friendship mixed with an unspoken understanding of who sleeps who, whose trash goes where etc... this made it difficult for us both to live independently ever since we moved here four years ago. 

The fact that i had kept my girlfriend secret till now really shocked everyone in our neighbourhood despite being open about the arrangement with her. Our mutual friend, Brian called every day after the news broke to ask about it but since he was usually stoned half his week he never seemed to notice what had gone down before they left anyway. In retrospect i don't think he was very capable of keeping the fact that i am actually a vampire hidden even if i wished i could be straight with him sometimes and instead let him figure things out the easy way - the old fashioned way- by watching me leave his house at midnigh twith bloody bites all over my face. He figured himself that there was something fishy about our almost non existant relationship just from being able to drink blood without any signs of decomposition. And though he tried to convince himself otherwise he always came to suspect things he didn't understand.

The words struck me as being very strange and not at all how I remembered. A voice sounded in my head, it was a kind but worried voice that made me feel quite safe. ""He has been with us since before we were aware of him."" 

I wasn't sure what I was thinking or feeling, all I knew is something was off. I looked around myself, everyone looking back at me with wide-eyed curiosity. This world felt too real for a moment. It felt like an advertisement from one of those commercials on tv. One where everything is hyper realistic and makes you think they are real. But it didn't even seem like someone had put up those screens before me.

""What do you mean by 'when we were aware of him'?"" I asked, trying to clear my head to be able to formulate more questioningly questions to ask.

""Well there is much more we haven't yet talked about about what has happened. Perhaps some time during our free time, or sometime in between his appointments.""

And then another person appeared. The last few faces that passed me were just like any other passerby but there were now two people standing next to me, their eyes focused solely on me staring blankly ahead instead of their surroundings like a normal citizen should. I began to panic slowly realizing that I couldn't breathe. Not anymore. At least not without gasping for air.

""Hello?"" one of the new faces spoke in slow but reassuring tone. ""My name is Vincent and this is Alice. You are a bit confused so let's sit down somewhere. Let's take a break."" They did as they said and led me to a restaurant nearby.

This was going to be a long conversation.

","It started with the nose...  I looked at my reflection in a shop window and didn't recognize my own face.  My hair was short, but I wasn't familiar with having a buzz cut before.  Then I reached up to touch it, and felt something on top of my fingers.  Was that hair?   

When I turned around to see who would have put this thing there, everyone else stopped what they were doing and stared at me.  I took my hand away from my head, then glanced back to where I saw the weird things on my finger. 

There was nothing left.   And then everything became black.

","""Please don't get eaten,"" I said to no one as he got closer and closer, a big grey wolf eating what appeared to be a young girl dressed in pink and white. It then turned its head to look at me like he was trying to figure out who had called him over. ""I want you guys to live!""

He licked his lips and let out a groan and yawned which revealed very yellow teeth. I took another step back but there is nothing behind me. No one around here helps anyone except animals anymore...and they always end up being killed by each other! When I saw this large grey creature I knew my only hope of surviving here was the wolves. There really wasn't any choice on if I will die or not, so why fight? ""Oh well,"" I sighed and closed my eyes. Nothing is going to change things now anyway. All that mattered at this point were whether or not I could keep my eyes shut for the longest time possible while enjoying peace with the animal and possibly dying peacefully with it, rather than fearfull.

A few more steps and all of a sudden I realized why everyone told people to never go into the woods alone ever again. That wasn't how the animals worked; no matter the species, humans and animals have never been close friends to begin with; sometimes even killing those they once considered friends can be justified. And yet, something pulled me towards that beast and whatever reasons it came up against me may not even save myself or the girl from getting eaten. She looked like she had run away from her bullies; if she didn't do that to find help, maybe someone would notice the smell of blood and come rescue her. 

Whatever happened here seemed quite random, the wolf wouldn't even think twice about it either, especially since a human did run into our path and scared the fuck outta them. Maybe we both should thank whoever caused this situation: an unexpected visitor has gotten rid of a very deadly threat. The little girl smiled at me again and walked out of my sight as I watched in amazement. At least tonight my nightmares will be far less gruesome.


In the future, however, wolves are still feared predators, but thanks to a person's generosity, they became one of the few creatures alive where man could have their own peaceful coexistence. This meant all wolves needed protection; and thus evolved alongside other predators, forming a brotherhood and a sisterhood of sorts. With such power comes responsibility and vice versa, making sure you choose right when making the decision is extremely easy. But nobody chose wrong.

A single man rose from a crowd of three.

This was not fair; it'd been like this from day one. One hero after another failed my test until eventually everyone but me had given up hope in humanity. 

My test was simple: destroy something that holds special meaning to someone (I didn't specify anything in advance). The ones who passed had found solace in loss, or at least some semblance thereof, while those who were unsuccessful grew more cynical over time as their search for worth was slowly extinguished by failure.

","A new kid was walking down the street trying to find a place to sit and eat. He had been wandering around aimlessly since his dad died and he didn't have anywhere to go that night, until some kind stranger gave him something hot, tasty, and fresh: pizza.

There were a lot of kids at this pizzeria so they opened up an additional 2-for-1 deal as a bonus! It took all he could to not grab both slices, but one wasn't enough, anyway; and just then someone in line bumped into his back with their shopping bag - luckily no big damage (though now he really REALLY wanted two). This led to some screaming between the person and him - he was obviously not happy about it - and before he knew it everyone in the line heard the loud noises. Suddenly a crowd formed behind them like a giant wall holding onto everything in sight. The only difference was that they were yelling, ""RUN"", ""RUN"", ""RUN""! It seemed some evil force stopped everyone on their tracks instantly - but not him. It looked to be because people were being forced from moving any forward, while he was running backward. No matter how hard he ran though, those walls always got in front of him as if nothing happened. The pizza stood frozen in his hands however, while everywhere else people fell over each other and started rolling forward blindly. When the ground shook again, everyone realized their mistake and froze once more, waiting for what came next.

He saw everything clearly when he tripped forward. All sorts of flying debris smashed against the side of the building. Something knocked him unconscious along with the others.

When he woke up things were silent except for birds singing outside his window. The sun was setting and he felt as if he was living through some strange dream, even after looking at himself in the mirror and seeing that his reflection stared right back. Even so, he thought there must be at least one other surviving person somewhere, but the police weren't helping in their pursuit. If he did fall asleep last night it would mean he missed another day with no food or water...

Then he decided to check what was left inside of his backpack as a backup plan in case the worst scenario came to pass - at least if there *was* another person then maybe the cops wouldn't catch him. While rummaging for a change of clothes he found something incredible. With trembling fingers he pulled out a huge package covered by many layers of brown paper wrapping. His heart began to skip a beat whenever he slowly peeled back another layer. He gasped and stared in complete awe as the final covering slowly opened to reveal three gleaming golden pistols beneath white gloves. The plastic sheathed pistol holster said *""G**a'n S****o'*.*

""Why?"" he cried while shaking with fear. That's all anyone dared ask the moment he shouted those words at the cops. They listened carefully until someone started talking, and they never finished his question.

","I had spent several years planning this scheme of mine. I've got every detail down pat in my mind- when to strike, how many members, what will be my grand excuse for my actions. But as always the day comes much sooner than expected. After all no one can stop what they don't see coming. And tonight was no exception.

I stood alone with a group of children sitting around me as I gave my speech. For an audience normally composed of people 13 years old or older it was surprisingly quiet during my act. This is not unusual by any stretch though. Most of these children wouldn't have seen anything but bad after dark growing up with their family. In fact some were even taught to do little more than hate anyone larger and taller than themselves. So if some guy showing up dressed like a clown that looks suspiciously like a child's favorite character isn't frightening enough, well then that kid just doesn't know any better.

The air is thick with emotion: fear, confusion, anger, hatred; a cauldron bubbling with excitement over what we did today; all that and nothing to do except stand quietly while the man at the front speaks... *how dare he steal our happiness from us! How dare he*

""Good morning!"" A woman exclaimed, clapping her hands and snapping them in the middle of the air before continuing her work. The crowd stirred, becoming confused about who she thought she was talking to as the man continued his talk through various monologues describing what was wrong with the community and explaining how, because of the lack of leadership amongst adults, he must assume power and use force as only he knew how. ""Now, why am I here?"" He asked. The group sat, quite confused on who is supposed to answer the question posed by the random person.

""To tell you why I need your help."" She yelled above the murmurs, waving a hand in the air before shouting across the room toward the empty space where she spoke. No one looked over. Everyone had the same confused look, wondering just who this lady was to make such claims. Well, if someone saw her come into the building last night, the name stuck in her head. It was pretty funny actually. Her daughter had been learning 'stand back and wait until the boss tells us what to do'. What a joke right? As far as kids went most of those things never came back around so why couldn't it stay consistent?! Who cared?! Now, however, her daughter was a soldier training to take over the company someday! One single punch could win him immortality. All it took was one good hit and BAM death was now hers. So when she said that everyone should look behind her, the soldiers obeyed. The only problem was half of them heard her say 'look behind you', instead of 'look behind me'. Then the fight started getting out of control. There was only three seats left open near the center which meant only three people stood up. The rest sat down as the first two men moved forward, eyes narrowed, waiting for the third to fall asleep in preparation for their attack. ""If you want to live don't make a sound."" She shouted, raising her pitch and looking straight ahead. They were silent. She turned slightly and pointed down her arm pointing to each finger moving up the arm like an arrow shot towards the heart.

""Take this for your survival!"" She yelled into her microphone and threw it upon the floor. Everyone jumped back screaming and scrambling for cover. A loud sound suddenly broke off from the floor of the hall: A small metallic whirring noise followed with soft scraping sounds of metal against metal. An axe swung down towards the ground shattering the silence.

A sharp feeling rushed up her shoulder blade, her eyes narrowing quickly.

Suddenly another axe swung and crashed on the floor alongside another voice saying ""Why did you bring up my past?!""

","I sit at my computer, looking through all the applicants for my position as next great hero. There were hundreds of letters sent in last week and I'm now sifting through them. Not really reading them though... just scanning for those little quirks that will tell me if a person can be worth being trained and molded into an actual super-hero... 

A few hours pass and finally, after scanning a hundred pages, one name caught my eye: ""Jason, age 18... seems capable...""

My eyes skim quickly over the rest of his letter. A bit bland but filled with strong moral ideals and a strong sense of justice. One that is completely lacking today's generation. He isn't afraid of taking risks either, which is something that needs to be developed before he's allowed access to any of my training classes. Still pretty far away from heroic ideal but decent.

""Okay, Jason,"" I muttered to myself. I pick up the phone on my desk and dial number one on my contact list. The sound of the old rotary receiver dials to life on my side while answering on the other end.

""Yes?"" comes back on the line.

""Can you come to my lab here at the headquarters? In three minutes, please.""

**Five Minutes Later...**

An ominous green glow starts to pulse around Jason as he walks into the room in full uniform. My light beam stops pulsing around him with it's red color and instead pulses like someone took the light inside a TV remote. The red pulsing stops entirely when it gets close enough to Jason.

He stands in front of me in the dimly lit white box of my makeshift laboratory.

He looks around, obviously curious about the strange surroundings yet somehow feeling calm despite the fact that I'm holding a device in my hand. It looked just like what I imagine a laser gun would look like, except a red laser instead of a blue one, but much smaller and more compact, like something ripped off a Nintendo gameboy advance or something else I wouldn't recognize.

I lift the trigger of the weapon causing a small puff of smoke to escape the gun and momentarily covering Jason face in haze. After it clears, however... the air suddenly becomes cold as my beams pierce through his heart, instantly melting his heart matter.

The shock and utter disbelief takes place for a minute until the heat from both ends begins radiating outwards, then slowly burns everything around Jason until only ash remains.

""...Oh God.. NOOOO!"" A voice rings across the empty building, but soon silence consumes the microphone again leaving nobody behind but the crackling static of dead electricity.

In seconds I hear another loud voice break into the silent vacuum. ""God Dammit Michael, get your act together! Someone killed him in the hallway...""

","""For the most part, I think everything that you see in The Onion is true,"" replied Dr. Richard Cringle as he opened his journal ""Chronology of the 21st Century."" After decades of research, only one person had ever doubted his work.

The historian had been called into the White House after having spent 3 years reviewing the papers, but she was not intimidated by the room full of men with ties and collars. Her glasses were thick enough for everyone to know that she would refuse to speak unless she wanted to, while also being so large that it felt impossible for someone not wearing them. All evidence pointed to the fact that her appearance hid an unyielding intelligence. She walked confidently in front of an intimidating crowd: the President of the United States of America, along with the Vice President, cabinet members, and heads of various organizations like NASA and the CIA. While they were all too scared to make eye contact, each one looked at their feet and fidgeted nervously in their chairs. It seemed like the first woman to ever be appointed to such an important position had finally broken through the barriers imposed on women since the days of Ancient Greece. And this was precisely why many of these individuals had never forgiven each other for taking her on in the first place.

Dr. Cringle stood before the presidents and congressmen and said ""As historians we search for answers to every question mankind has ever pondered. We look back through the ages at old societies, civilizations and empires; however there is still some mysteries that have always bothered me."" He gestured to a page in his journal which contained images of what appeared to be ancient humans standing in a room filled with light, staring at screens filled with video footage of animals that resembled dinosaurs.

Many people gasped during the presentation, including the president who slowly turned toward the screen where the image of the strange cave paintings could be seen clearly by anyone with strong eyes. His face contorted in confusion as he tried to grasp what lay before him. 

One of the politicians behind the podium whispered to another, “I've got chills.” But no body made any move to turn off the lights or turn down the projector since they couldn't read the contents of the scroll because of how close it was to the white screen that reflected its colors. Some people leaned closer to get a better look, even leaning over those in front of them to get a proper angle. Meanwhile others struggled to keep themselves up out of embarrassment. Their faces reddened as they averted their gaze from the audience as fast as possible. Only the president dared take a picture, holding his phone as high up above the surface as possible. When it went out of focus the reporters quickly shot up out of their seats and asked him questions. In spite of the president not being able to reply the camera-toting politician insisted upon shooting more pictures anyway. However, when one of the journalists asked him what he thought happened in the picture, he simply shrugged and said ""I have no idea"".


After several minutes of trying to justify everything happening he eventually just gave up and left the podium. The scientists continued talking, telling us to ignore the possibility that this might be alien technology. Despite his colleagues and their inability to comprehend what he spoke of Dr. Cringles knowledge surpassed anything the rest had. Many believed that aliens came to Earth in the late 70s though, as the government had started releasing tapes of extraterrestrial creatures performing their advanced music as a way to show people what to expect if the aliens did actually come. There was a new wave of immigrants coming in now; all claiming their bloodlines descended from humans who met the lizard people instead of going back to Atlantis. Not a single one of those people looked anything like Dr. Cringle knew he was right anyway.

","“The best we can do is estimate the value.”

Mr. Smith took out his pipe and began swirling smoke around its thin end as he looked me dead in the eyes; his grey eyes with their deep wrinkles held nothing but respect. A man who had spent a quarter century writing down history, it was strange I shouldn’t be intimidated by him. Especially because now he knew my greatest fear: being left behind.  Even though there were only three days left in my lifespan. Even if I have only one day to write my life story.

It all happened so fast. But that didn’t stop them coming for me sooner or later. As soon as they caught sight of me stumbling on the street after drinking too much beer at the pub. An old-fashioned black suit was clearly not built for my current physique, which made no surprise considering how many years had gone by since I last wore anything other than a torn pair of jeans and T-Shirt. My face was covered in dirt and oil, the tattoos peeking out from underneath my shirt showed the wear from our hard fights against the soldiers trying to kill us both; we were trying to escape the clutches of Big Brother, to get away from the machines who watched everything you did. We managed to sneak into the sewers below the city, hide beneath the ground while waiting for an opportunity to make our escape when all hell broke loose. In the blink of an eye everything changed forever...


A war erupted between nations of men, the humans thought it would be over by nightfall but the enemy wasn't going to let go willingly. Soon the fighting spread everywhere and then...

""So tell me what was your biggest fear?""  My voice cracked slightly; it sounded weird hearing myself speak like that. ""And why has the world come to an end in front of you while everyone else stayed safe? You know this isn't supposed to happen. So why haven't they called an immediate retreat for everyone yet?"" His smile faded. He rubbed his chin and nodded slowly before turning to his table to rummage through some papers. It takes him a few seconds to turn back again; he said he needed a moment. ""I won't force you Mr. Smith, but if someone tries to force you you must inform an official immediately; I don't want anyone blaming me. Now, where were we?"" I could see the gears working in his brain as he turned back to me with the look once more.

""...what is The Onion?"", the room felt too cold, my head spinning. This thing should've been impossible, even in 2073 it still seemed unbelievable. How could something made up from lies still be able to sway opinions around the globe; especially not just one nation. Was this the first ever instance of such activity? Did they know that this technology existed and decided to use it to further their own agenda? Why hadn't they stopped the machine before? They knew what to expect; their army never went on a mission without knowing exactly what weapon would hit them and where.

His response came slowly this time, ""...they are a fictional satirical news organization, and the fact that they claim to post verified true stories may have started to gain traction because..."" he looked away for a second, avoiding my gaze, ""...in that year...the internet was invented.""

""There's wars with demons that have appeared randomly out of thin air, and an alien race in Europe that can move things across the country faster than you can imagine. It sounds like another one of those drunken stories we heard once when we tried to make it to Jupiter for your birthday party, but it seems all too real!"" 

The two other men looked at each other briefly before he continued. ""I am just starting to wonder if this old building and its contents were buried so deep under the earth for centuries because they could see that life would be lost in our attempt to recreate them once again."" he sighed and started pacing his office. ""To many new technologies have arrived since then to leave any sort of evidence behind.""



""Well,"" Professor Brown said. He scratched his beard as he rubbed his chin. ""Perhaps its worth looking into. We do not know what else might be possible unless we look into all angles, and while i may seem crazy to you, it makes sense. All governments try desperately hard to hide truth about their history even though most forget anything from years ago. Why not go back in time?""


They both stood silent for a long moment watching the fire crackle inside their hearth before deciding that the professor was right. They could spend years or weeks working on this alone, perhaps find something valuable for themselves, maybe some hidden technology or knowledge, but why waste all of this time? It might also be good for Dr. Jackson to see a different perspective on science besides the research papers and academic journals he used every day.  


They contacted the school's administration and asked permission to borrow a plane to explore ancient structures across Europe. After months of preparation and searching, they came face to face with what remained of the buildings from the period after 9/11, and indeed found no remnants of either the first world war nor World War II.

I have to say I was shocked it had taken this long since last episode to finally get my question on. That wasn't what surprised me most though, no, what surprised me was how long this one took when they started filming the same interview again...  the third time had only been 20 minutes, while the first two times were recorded a full half an hour more before the show went live. This whole thing was ridiculous. I wanted answers, but all we got was a bunch of corporate bull-crap in this goddamn infomercial for some pointless product. It was so obviously bullshit that you could smell it off-camera even after they'd already cut away.

It made me wonder if the host knew what he was doing or not at all. ""Thank you"", he said as he waved goodbye. I guess I should be happy he still had a job. Who knows if he makes any sense off air, maybe he needs someone like me to give him his daily reality check. But that didn't justify watching those stupid ads. The worst part? People actually *liked* them. A great number clicked on the link I would occasionally post in their posts afterwards. As much as people hate me, it was easy to tell that none of them understood what they were going through: I wouldn't blame them either, because frankly, I don't either.

""I'm gonna guess Africa or South America, but who knows?"" Another person replied while reading a novel over his shoulders. ""It would be really cool to meet her though!""

They were laughing with joy as they watched out to see if there had been any updates on the news channel where several journalists reported live off of the beach where our precious friend is currently being carried by men dressed in white suits...



""She got washed up ashore at about 2:45 am today."" one journalist explained. The other responded ""Oh my god is this thing going viral! People thought it was just another shark encounter or whatever!"". As more people approached to examine the ""mermaid"", the two reporters left to speak with other tourists for the story. The three remaining remained on the scene observing the creature closely. It appeared calm and seemed very tired. With its beautiful blue scales flashing every so often and eyes closing softly throughout it's whole body; it radiated beauty beyond description.  

While observing the little girl whom we have named ""Finna"", the crew found herself looking directly into their eyes before she abruptly let loose a giant wave which knocked them all back, knocking over a cart nearby. Fortunately the mermaids tail hit a camera first causing no harm to anyone. While most of the cast members had fallen, Finna swam toward a large ship in the distance which was flying away from the beach already leaving everyone in shock at what has just happened.

But the real adventure began when a fisherman saw Finna get close to the water and jump onto a passing ship. He ran after her and asked for his son to go help him while he kept yelling for her not to try to fight back. They managed to grab the child who was crying desperately but immediately felt her pull against them. They knew that pulling too hard will only anger the fish but the cries didn't ease. ""My momma"" the baby screamed as she kept trying to get free from them.  At that moment Finna turned around and spoke in a perfect English accent: ""Take me back to your house...""


And so she was returned home again, still covered by layers upon layers of plastic bags. Only now she went under but soon emerged on another spot closer to land with a new face, hair color and teeth (that still glowed). And in return, everyone on the island wanted to know why.

The man signed the paper but then said ""No thanks"" as if he didn't want to give them more money than they were worth with him making these kinds of deals for years now.


I was surprised by how fast the ocean had changed color when I jumped into the shallow waters, but what stunned me most was the silence once I got to the surface. There wasn't any waves crashing against my skin, nor could I hear anyone screaming; not even a single bird screamed after seeing me walk ashore like a phantom. I thought maybe I got out at the best moment because there might be sharks but no, after getting up onto land I noticed two men running through the trees, each holding a rifle, aiming at me. They seemed determined to shoot first before asking questions - luckily they were too far away for me to hear their shots; hopefully the distance will protect me from gunshots anyway.


I think I'll stay here until morning, hoping no one comes looking again. What do I do with myself when it gets dark though? How long can a human survive without food or water alone on the beaches? It feels like I haven't eaten a decent meal since last year.


It was a nice summer night so I saw how beautiful a moonlit beach is.  Even when watching a shooting star fall near me, only stars seem to shine brighter than the fireflies. Though sometimes, there just aren't enough stars, am I correct?

","She had seen him yesterday as well. She'd almost hit her head on his hat, she would not be able to forget that sound- he was yelling as loud as he could ""I HAVE A BAG"", just before dropping down onto the track behind a few people. 

She got off at the last stop in front of her home and went home right away, the next train wouldn't be for another hour but still it felt like she shouldn't go back there. So she sat up on the stairs right near his place. He was sleeping very peacefully when she got close.

","The man stopped at her nose. ""Hey,"" he said, a long time before she blinked and looked up from the newspaper to face him.

""Everything okay?"" The paper slipped from her grasp.  She started running down the steps of the station that led into the underground cavern, only stopping when another person was near her and she was blocked from continuing any further along. 

He grinned, showing no teeth but an enormous set of gapes where he could have had several dentures. It hurt to smile, like her knees hurting after she hit them with her elbows while on ice skates. He nodded his head up at the mouth of the sewer and then pointed it towards her nose.

""You coming or what?"" His grin broadened, displaying his gums and upper incisors. He moved closer and pulled his coat off. Her eyes snapped back to the homeless bum's mouth and then dropped again to meet his gaze. What did he want? She began thinking as if talking slowly through a glass partition.

A cough rose from behind him. ""You need to tell us where they are. They will kill you, ma'am."" Another voice rang out, more feminine this time. A small woman in a large sweater wrapped in its full length and staring back out of the dark cavern toward Alice. She was pale, and she wore some sort of red tube socks underneath the big coat which showed a hint of blue around her ankles that went above her pants waist. That part of her leg remained covered. There would be nothing left for all their eyes to see except bare bone.

[removed]","""How do I know you are not here to kill me?""

""I came here undercover because it is your duty to ensure my safety, sir!""

""A task as dangerous as this that could potentially result in the loss of my job should be done by someone else."" 

""We do our duties first before we go after another, sir.""  said Smith. ""But also there is no way I would let myself get into harms way for some lowly criminal who will more than likely hurt me when they realize where I am, sir!  So if we are to carry out this mission properly then this needs to be handled like only an agent of this high caliber can."" 

""Do not forget what we spoke of beforehand."" I said as he sat down across from me and took his file off of my desk.  ""You'll find all kinds of secrets hidden within these pages including one that tells why I hired you.  Read them carefully."" He did as I said and opened it up and read as I moved to work around the house.  I had set an alarm to make sure he didn't wander too far in the time allotted so he wouldn't be detected before anyone got home.   He was supposed to stay silent until I heard him say the specific code word.    I kept walking without checking on him each few minutes, but he had been quiet and hadn't taken any photographs as well.  This meant that something was wrong and either he realized how crazy this sounded or found himself unable to complete this task.


""What is taking so long?"" asked the voice behind me and I went into the dining room as Agent Williams stood near my table.  

""Just reading some things over."" I replied.  I looked at her folder and saw there were still several reports missing, but nothing alarming.  ""Have you seen Mr. Peterson?"" she asked.

""No, last I remember seeing him before going to see Smith he was in his office. I assumed he'd called to cancel the plans."" I added thinking back about the meeting earlier that day.

I shook my head and smiled at her.  

Smith left shortly after she asked about Pete and she started talking again, and soon enough the rest of my team was standing behind me.  Williams and Peterson both looked ready to pounce on Smith, which made me chuckle inwardly.     Everyone relaxed their posture and began asking questions.  And as much as they enjoyed looking through Peterson's files I knew none of them were doing it with a keen eye.

""Mr. Smith you have gone above and beyond in bringing forth proof of illegal activity inside of the department. You have not only captured evidence of racial hate crimes but have gathered information on the corruption of several members of the elite forces and have given testimony against the highest ranked member of those groups.  I thank you for everything you have done."" Said Chief Bell with his face glowing and beaming.   It felt strange seeing him look like this, knowing that even though the investigation was being closed many others may not ever forgive him.



""Not to mention, we appreciate the dedication you've shown during your tenure at the NYPD. But now lets discuss your reward for all of this."" Chief Bell continued smiling widely.  My eyes widened slightly at the man saying this was such a huge relief to me.   Chief Bell handed me a sealed envelope from his pocket.   When I reached for it he raised a finger stopping my hand.

""We hope you understand Mr. Smith when we take away your badge today."" The Chief said solemnly.

## Detective's story 3/10 (reimagined)

""Agent Smith, please state your name and tell us who sent you.""  Said the Chief as I slowly removed my tie and hung it on the coat rack.  After a brief pause he repeated his instruction.

""Sir, may I ask for the contents of this briefcase?"".  Said Smith as I held it firmly in front of me.

""That is private information Agent Smith, please state your name and tell us who sent you."" Again I politely replied as I walked towards Smith.

I stepped closer to the man with a large briefcase in front of me.  The moment was tense and uncomfortable and it felt as if I was going to walk backwards and trip over my own feet, which is exactly what happened.  I fell into Smith, and although he landed lightly I couldn't believe the sheer amount of force applied between the two of us.

We struggled for seconds before falling onto the floor.  Once on the ground I reached for Smith's handgun tucked beneath the sleeve of his shirt.  As I did so, I slammed his head toward the coffee table next to me and brought my knee down hard on his neck, pinning him down with little effort.   His hands flew up in vain attempts to claw back onto his gun while gasping for air.   All I needed was one good shot and it would be all over...until my hand slipped and I hit the poor fella between his ribs.

""Oh god help me.."" the words escaped his lips as a cough filled the air.  He pulled himself up and stared at me.   His eyes had lost most of their fire but gained a new focus.  I dropped my gun.

""God helps the wicked,"" I thought to myself as I put him back in his seated position.   He sighed deeply and said...how was I to know?

""Let's try this again..agent smith, please say your name and explain your intentions.""  This time I acted quickly.   One quick yank to Smith's elbow pinned him right where he was and I swung my foot directly at his jaw, hitting him square in the mouth.

Again, silence descended upon us as he clutched at the side of his mouth.   I had knocked him cold.  Before I finished off the remaining parts of his body I gave him the old fashioned treatment of kicking him and yelling ""standardized procedure"".  When he rose on all fours and returned my stares, I was glad I had waited til now to call his security detail as their arrival would probably mean I wasn't coming out of here alive.

Now comes the tough part, getting rid of the gun.   I searched through Smiths bag and found it wedged in between a notebook and pen.   With a slight tug, it was freed; though not easily!  I felt pain shoot through my shoulder as i squeezed the trigger and watched in horror at the bright light from Smith's .45 Magnum firing once into the ceiling before leaving a nasty mess all over the place.  I cursed at the stupidity, rushing to finish shooting until my bullets finally left empty.  I grabbed the fallen pistol and headed back through my own hole-ridden hallway, making sure it was clear of bodies.  Finally clearing the entrance into the dark alley below, I lit my cigarette as calmly as possible.  If anything happened, there was nowhere near enough smoke to hide behind so at least I hoped for.

There had to be someone nearby, watching from a distance.   To hell with them, they didn't want to be in the dark anyway.

Turning the corner, I noticed someone with a flashbang grenade stuck in their belt.  In my best John wick impressions, I used this opportunity to dive underneath cover as a loud BANG and crack echoed throughout the city as sparks flew everywhere from both ends of the alleyway.   Moments later, the guy popped up covered in grease and blood and running full throttle.

For days, I chased him relentlessly, following every direction he turned except towards me.   He vanished from sight just days later, apparently caught in traffic and never heard from since.  Eventually a news report came across my radar stating that some kid died in a car crash and his family wanted to pay respects, so I joined the gathering of reporters outside the chapel, wondering what became of them and hoping it was really over.

However, I do think I can help flesh out your story a little bit further and add in more specific details/themes. It may be the exact setting or scenario as the anime series, but what makes your version better? What are some plot points you want me to explore?

* **The reasons behind the corruption:** Are they bribed by money (a traditional mafia trope), powerful drug lords, gangs running illicit businesses like weapons manufacturers, etc., something less conventional or even related to politics?   
* **The methods used to investigate:** The use of Blacked people as informants, baiting them into giving up information for pay, using their connections or personal lives or whatever else is available without actually getting involved yourself. 
* **The fallout that occurs when it comes down the pipe:** Who knows about this particular branch of the black population that does not know it existed, and who has been hurt. Does one die as punishment for betraying his own brethren, a white person being lynched or killed based on unsubstantiated accusations or threats, racial profiling gone too far, etc.?

[removed]","The streets were silent save for my steps, but I wasn’t the only one walking them at this time of night. My shadow was long and low against the wet asphalt as I walked silently towards the dimly lit bakery shop on the corner of Main Street. The bell above its door chimed when I opened it softly and stood there in the doorway until the owner appeared over the counter after a moment or two.

“Morning Mr Brown.” I said. “One coffee, black please.” The owner handed me my drink from behind the counter and we left silence once again fill the quiet shop, save for our hushed breathing and the hum of the ventilation system in the kitchen behind us. We locked eyes momentarily before each returned to their duties. I knew that he was always right there to see me leave as soon as the first shift light came up, but for tonight I didn’t care if he saw me. Tonight all I could see was him looking away as he prepared to deliver our secret orders; I couldn’t help but wonder if he knew the truth about what was happening in this city anymore than any of his officers did. 

That guy probably knew more than he was letting on too–I don't understand why they would even bother trying to recruit someone like him knowing damn well the danger his position put him in. But the way he moved through the street with the other men… maybe he is just another cog in the machine. Or maybe, just maybe…. This whole investigation that I had been assigned to for the past few months was an illusion. Maybe I was going crazy thinking so. There are some guys on the force who have made deals with the devil. At least the city knows how many cops really are working with him. And I think I might be next. Fuck it. I should never have trusted that guy. No matter what we told each other back then, no matter the money or power involved–the trust is broken anyway. It doesn’t matter where it comes from anyway. Just fuck everything and run.

","The old man pulled out his wallet and sighed. All but one of its letters were worthless- they had expired in 2083 or earlier. He then flipped open the final piece of paper, the note was dated 14th October 2097 - *This should hold up long enough* he thought to himself.

""Hello sir, would you like your last letter?"" asked the grim-looking postman. The Old Man knew better than most that the mailman meant *nothing comes free of charge*. He paid the fee, hoping it could get him through another three years until the mailman came again.

""Yes.""
---------------------

A month passed with no complaints about the envelope. It came exactly when the man remembered. The date on the parchment remained uncorrupted, even though it had been months past its expiry date. ""Maybe this will work,"" he said to himself, as he put the envelope to use.

It didn't, however, but not for much longer. One evening, when he woke from a nap whilst relaxing by a crackling fireplace near the hearth, he noticed his house lights flicker dimly. When they switched off completely, he saw them before he heard them; a bright red box hovering menacingly above the chimney.

A few moments later, he witnessed their full arrival: seven pairs of pincer-like fingers grabbing for the door handles of four separate trucks. They burst into the room and started shooting out various weapons. The gunners got tired eventually, but not after some very unfortunate mistakes.

Just one minute ago, the postman hadn't entered his home; now there was almost fifty men holding firearms down each wall outside. But those that hadn't have fled away from the carnage - leaving behind all manner of loot that wouldn't sell anywhere near the post-apocalypse price.

After what felt like hours, the guns fell silent and one by one, the Red Box men walked down into the kitchen. In the middle of the room stood a single man, armed with an AK.

He stared straight at Mr. Evans and pointed it directly at him. The two men made eye contact and held firm, neither breaking posture. For far too many seconds the silence remained unbroken. Then, with as strong a voice as anyone has ever produced after weeks of eating nothing but dehydrated lentils, Evans yelled.

""Hey there fellas! You guys wanna take a look? I've got just the thing!""

Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment, as if he hadn't gone insane. His fellow survivors nodded slowly at the sight. And then came the moment everyone had all hoped for; finally, someone was going to start selling their junk, starting with their wallets.

""I don't want to take anything.""

Evans grinned happily. *Not like it matters anyway,* he thought, knowing that no one really needed any money right now. ""There are plenty of houses still standing over there,"" he gestured with his hand towards the road leading west - east, he wasn't sure where they lived. ""You can take whatever you want...""

""...But please, let me help you find what you need. Like these bags..."" *Here, here.* ""Those are more valuable, but also heavier to move."" And so, a deal was struck, and both sides left satisfied, albeit somewhat surprised and bemused by the unexpected turn of events, especially the former Redbox men. A few minutes afterwards, as everything seemed to be back to normal except the smell of burnt wood and bullets, Evans realized he was smiling.

","The red box came earlier than usual. The mailman has begun to be more erratic of late, sending letters in groups instead of one per man he delivers to. I checked for contraband before I ate dinner today but nothing was amiss.

""Why?""

I thought my words must have been loud so I covered my mouth with one hand as I read the letter. What little privacy I had left was quickly eroded by the fact that my front door window did not have curtains. As the woman who I purchased it from said ""They wouldn't keep out monsters."" My dad and I laughed at the time over how impossible it would be for the monster we saw on the internet to come through this small frameless glass rectangle. How wrong we were.

I threw the window shut then carefully made my way up the stairs leading to my bedroom which had its own balcony so if there is a fire in the room directly below me I might be able to throw some sort of flame extinguisher over the ledge and watch him burn. But what do I know about monsters? And why don't they call it The Monster Room? Where they leave your body when you die, or whatever this disgusting thing is doing anyway.. 

There's no turning back now though. Why did I think going into retirement would give me any better life? At least a normal prison has an end date for your sentence, unless a mistake happens and you get extra time for crimes like failing grade school! 

This is something far worse. It may very well just kill us all.

(End of episode)


I opened the envelope and scanned the contents. In bold bold letters it simply stated:

**YOUR TIME HAS COME.**



I walked towards the kitchen where my mom and dad were sitting down to eat dinner. I could smell that awful dish again and felt myself slowly succumb back to my addiction that began during those long sleepless nights studying for the SATs in highschool. Yes I want to live like it used to. No I am not going to lie and tell them that everything is fine because their lives have been eaten away bit-by-bit since my dad started working his third part-time job at a local coffee shop to pay off the bills and my mom quit her job at McDonalds because she decided people couldn't afford to live without her being around the store every morning, even once our neighbor became terminally ill after catching Covid, as did most of everyone else on our street, and even though Mom kept telling herself to stay home for a week it got longer and longer until she couldn't anymore, leaving Dad alone to pick up the slack and our cat. Cat stayed inside with no other choice but to become feral as none of her toys or litterbox worked without electricity and food rationing for us went bad after weeks. The old family dog had died of heart failure by the time Dad brought it in from walking in the yard. And then Grandma passed and everyone in town stopped seeing anyone except Dad whenever anyone wasn't busy eating. Nobody noticed the strange notes sent to each house. They weren't addressed to specific individuals but to everybody. After all nobody knew when anybody would be dead anyways.




If you're lucky enough that you've lived long enough with everybody around you dead you'll notice that it goes against common sense to take care of yourself. That you never go to the grocery store alone knowing it'll be full again tomorrow. You start locking doors even when your wife or whoever is beside you says it's okay because you won't actually be alive much longer anyway, and lock the closet too, you know, when you realize your ex doesn't have kids and probably wont miss you anyway. Even if the locks can't stop someone breaking in they can sure as hell slow them down enough to make a hasty escape or at the very least buy a couple of minutes while everyone catches a cab somewhere for the last time.

In short our street isn't safe. We have plenty of folks wandering the streets looking for easy money, which I assume will be soon found, especially when that red envelope arrived early.  And oh boy does mine mean business! This is a dark corner of my mind I try not to venture into very often these days, hoping to avoid dwelling on just how many days have gone past and not counting. How many meals Mom and Dad haven't touched due to fear that they'd just be killed right there and then as well? That phone call from my brother to ask to borrow 50 bucks for groceries only to hang up right before hanging himself outside the laundromat two blocks from his apartment building and nobody knows yet because he hasn't seen the note. He didn't get a letter like ours. Maybe he's still alive somewhere? Or maybe thats whats next for our entire block. Everythings getting weirder lately. The dogs barking sounds different lately too. They sound almost.. angry.

My parents usually take breaks after their meal together to sit back and watch tv for awhile, even now despite not having cable they manage to find some form of entertainment even if it's just reruns from ten years ago, and for whatever reason they always sit on the couch in silence. My mother takes out her favorite teacup and saucer from the set we received as a wedding gift and enjoys the warm beverage while my father turns on the telly and puts the remote on 'Shuffle' (he hates commercials). Tonight though the television keeps switching channels. Sometimes it stays on blackscreen, then flashes between various news channels, then suddenly cuts to another station and repeats the same pattern. Then it goes straight back to black. When it goes back it switches between channel surfing. Is this some new technological advancement? Some sort of glitch? Something tells me no, there just isn't a lot to talk about in the bleak world we live in and they seem determined not to let me know anything at all.
My father stands and stretches. ""Come on sweetie,"" he says, ""Let's turn this program on before you tire yourself out."" I've already drifted into dreamland listening to him tap the button and I barely hear him saying that. I just wish I knew how to reply back.

","It was quite easy for a lonely man like me to forget what it felt like to be loved. It had been many years since I last saw my family. Some of us chose this route. Others took a different one. As far as I knew no one escaped it. My wife and children were taken while their car broke down from all the red boxes going too high in front of them. They have not been seen ever since then.

A single letter remained in my pocket. I would sell it if possible but there were very few people who gave anyone a chance these days. 30 cents may just be enough to keep me fed tonight and maybe give me something to drink. The cold wind kept biting away at my face which made me shiver for a few minutes and pull out a pack of cigarettes as best I could before lighting one up. I held onto her letter tight with both hands but felt it slip out so I tried once more. Not again. ""Damn,"" I thought frustrated at myself, but stopped when hearing the knock knock knock. A faint voice started saying, ""Open up"" I opened the door a little bit first and stuck my phone out towards the voice to see what they wanted. A big hand swooped into mine with one hand and my back pressed against the wall. It's always better to cooperate early than later.

","It was a bitter cold December morning. The British troops on the outskirts of Alsace were huddled around their stoves, shivering. In the nearby trenches the German guns rumbled low, barely audible through the snow.

A French general came to see his men. He raised his hand and called down silence. A great voice boomed out from below ""Is there anyone still in favour for us to give them a warm welcome? Is that it then?""

Only five voices responded, and after a while he went over the list again ""Yes. I will go to the front.""

The general looked back at the line and asked again ""Anyone here but these five left?"" Another three hands shot up. The General clapped his hands together ""Good!"" Then looking at the man next to him said ""And you are also joining! Don't think me stupid just because you are speaking English. Only your brother, who is serving in France under American command does know how important this day is. It is an honor. To all our friends, good fighting boys! For glory, or death!""

He took off towards where the tanks awaited him in the mud. They fired into each other, the two armies having done little else between one another since Berlin had fallen last summer. 4 hours later the war began once more... As did the deaths. Two weeks after the first attack France gave Germany a taste of its own medicine by making Hitler die on the same day as Charles de Gaulle. In short order the Allied powers stopped wanting the war. It ended with Europe being partitioned and everyone going home. But most importantly: France has no history now. No Nazi invasion means there has never been a civil war either. And so none of the political maneuvering, or any bloodshed occurred. In consequence no nation has ever grown strong enough to invade Napoleon's homeland of France. So what we have here now is nothing like the real thing. No soldiers fighting for freedom, merely mercenaries hired by both sides to kill whichever army their sponsors want dead. Neither side can win the war. But if France is never invaded by anyone, the world becomes too safe. Just another time in history where luck beats intellect when faced against some evil mastermind determined to create chaos.


Note: If Britain hadn't signed the Treaty of Versailles, I imagine Hitler would have attacked a different part of western Europe. This would be an interesting historical counter-what-if.
However, if Hitler *had* sent troops to the Rhineland, the Allies might well have responded quickly and efficiently, preventing the entire Second World War. On a smaller scale the US would have joined the fight to secure the Suez Canal and India, ensuring peace in East Asia while Europe fell. We may thank the Treaty of Versailles entirely - without any wars from 1870 onwards (as long as they didn't occur somewhere *else*) it meant Japan never wanted territory within Eurasia.

42,"France and England started WWII early as they decided to not allow Germany to Remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936.
","It was a bitter war of attrition, fought with men. Not only did each side suffer heavy losses, but the fighting went on for weeks at a time with neither side making any ground. There was plenty of propaganda both sides could boast about as well; stories were written that claimed one had broken, or defeated, the other more than half a dozen times. In truth both armies were merely tired from endless fighting without major victories either side saw fit to report back to its government.

America wasn't keen on seeing Europeans fight again, but they couldn't turn their backs on Europe when they were attacked by Germans who happened upon the island nation of New Zealand. To America all those old European countries meant absolutely nothing, especially considering how much land the United States occupied alone. Their interest began and ended with the fact that they had sunk an aircraft carrier off the coast of Canada. As it turned out the Canadians were able to send some of their pilots over with reinforcements but they landed just far enough south to ensure any survivors would be brought home. But things got weird when the Allies finally took Berlin and learned what the Nazis had been doing during the interwar period. The Americans didn't take many prisoners because nobody knew German soldiers had gotten so far north after Germany surrendered in Europe to start training with Soviet troops to form the ""Northern Union"". But none of them seemed interested in continuing the fight. They were happy enough patrolling the coast, raiding Japanese shipping lanes, and launching kamikaze attacks with their trusty old 'borrowed' aircraft carriers before retreating to their proper territory in Japan. America hadn't expected that kind of patriotism from its former enemies, though as the Americans found themselves slowly being pushed into Africa with France and Britain they realized this thing might be getting real interesting. And while the French and British eventually managed to push further and further into Africa and the Soviets through sheer willpower managed to keep up, nobody ever bothered to stop and see why Japan had stayed so long at sea, even as they kept sending new ships every day. After all there weren't too many things the Japanese could possibly learn from the Germans besides good guns.

The German people were overjoyed; Hitler said something along the lines ""We will never have another war on our soil again!"" And he was right; because that's exactly what happened...but only once. After being a failed dictatorship for so long, the new Nazi regime fell apart and fled across the border into France where some brave Germans escaped their own fate and joined the allied army. Soon enough they realized how stupid their dictator really was though and switched sides. This made things worse, but then everything went out of control. The Allies formed a small coalition to protect Prussia from German invasion (that actually was part of the old united kingdom) and soon found themselves marching towards the old Prussian capital Berlin. During this time they weren't noticed by the world, nor did anybody believe them, however the Nazis still attempted to attack, which meant there was no other way than to meet force with force. So they called upon their greatest weapon: The Red Army (with no Soviet Union backing), who marched south from Russia, while the British marched west from France, the Soviets captured Moscow, burned down the Kremlin, killed off several million Russians and finally reached Berlin. In the end it took 75,000 dead Allies, countless cities burned down and hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians perished for the Allied victory. On top of this Britain got nothing accomplished as their main ally died during the battle, forcing them to take on the whole Nazi Empire alone. 24 years later, the victorious Allies built up an enormous military and eventually conquered the former empire making sure nobody ever forgets this war

When we invaded Italy after having a few close calls fighting our way through Austria, the Italians realised they were facing an unknown enemy when they first fought us. They learned quickly though and threw everything they had at us, turning the tides of the war and sending us home before even reaching Rome. Then came Spain which stood no chance whatsoever. What a fight to win but with the combined effort of Britain and America we defeated Spain and pushed northwards before retreating back to England and hoping there would be nothing left of Axis-land except ashes. But of course as expected, Germany and Italy kept rebuilding their armies whilst refusing to surrender.

","I've been thinking about all the little things I can do and that no-one could ever notice.  All this time as a genie granting wishes has meant seeing people make big changes in their lives through my power, so really it's not my wish to make any changes at all.  Even though most of us want power or money the end goal is always some kind of happiness.

Now every time a new person comes around asking me to make them happy I usually ask myself ""How would a 30 year old man go insane if he couldn't escape his job?"" A wise question since many would give themselves up to death before they came across my island.  I see a lot of sad faces now as well as angry eyes from frustrated men yelling at me ""YOU MAKE ME THE RICHEST MAN IN THIS ISLAND!"" Or ""MAKE ME THE HIGHEST RANKED SOLDIER AND GIVE ME YOUR DRAGON!"".  I sigh as another young child asks for just about everything imaginable.  ""A dragon? Really boy?"" I say ""Maybe something more simple than that.""  Then the last time she got upset about her situation because her parents aren't rich enough I tell her ""Alright kid, here we go"".  Sure enough now I hear laughter after she leaves but instead of coming back for answers with her mouth agape I shake my head dejectedly looking outside my hut.


There used to be a great deal of evil beings on my rock in exchange for giving me away.  However due to greed now there were very few that sought out someone to free them, they just took advantage of any genie they found regardless of what I wanted from them in return for doing the same thing.  It was hard to keep track of which ones they had released already until finally a woman arrived in the middle of the day with a very desperate expression.  ""I need to get home,"" she said shaking her hands as tears streamed down her face ""Please help me! We need me!"" Her voice cracked at the end and so with nothing left to give I agreed with a slight laugh, although most times I did this without hesitation there were a number of times where they would try to bargain with me beforehand.  I asked questions trying to determine her intention when she replied, ""We are going to go after the king of the land he betrayed our father and murdered him!"".  I thought for a moment when suddenly the sun went dark.

The first time this happened I told her to bring back anything else that might be useful such as weapons or armor and I threw a pair of shoes into space, then laughed to no avail.  Of course as soon as it landed I pulled her out of whatever was above this wretched island.  Apparently she gave up in fear when only finding a mountain of black lava, so as to make things interesting for me I turned a small volcano erupting right beside the beach on while shouting random words out loud, making sure I didn't step away for even a second.  I had hoped it would frighten her, but it had worked much too well.  She walked up onto the lava and screamed before falling to her death instantly.  At least some of her family will benefit as now when kings act as heroes she will be able to claim the position for herself and take revenge on those who dare betray her.




After all she tried to kill a demon that freed an entire species of goblins.  I smiled smugly over the centuries that passed as a group of children started playing near the water's edge of my island.  Their screams rang out across the sea in unison with thunder.

","""Do not grant someone evil enough power and they will find ways to exploit it; Do not give anyone too much power and they may use it carelessly. You must be a balance between both.""

My mother used to say this all the time before she passed away in a strange plane crash when I was four years old. 

The story goes that she saw me playing with my toy magic box while we were flying over the ocean towards the coast on vacation. As if in response to her question about what kind of magic powers a person has at two years old, I said ""Genie"" and flew straight into the sky from our seats as though there was something pulling on my body! 

Before we even knew how she had gotten into such an unimaginable position in a plane full of people, I had already landed next to the side railing looking down at everyone. My parents got the message but I did not. They asked me why I wanted to get out the window and so when I told them I wanted to see the world, well...there wasn't anything else for it.

","""My wish is granted.""

""Oh well..."" I muttered as I looked at it. ""One more power boost and I would be god-level now,"" I said thinking back at my first wish when I was barely alive yet, when I freed myself from my prison on the Earth where they made me. It had been so long ago, but all that memory remains were fleeting moments that I could recall in times of boredom. A simple game of chess is the only thing I have to keep me going while I wait.


I stood with hands folded in front of my face, waiting for someone to ask for a wish. It takes many years when trying to find anyone truly capable of realizing their deepest desires once you lose all access to most resources needed to support them. In fact, it has been over 15 years since I've gotten any proper requests, despite having several people asking for wishes throughout the year... But something else makes it difficult: They never know how far off a wish will take them or if they will eventually come begging before fulfilling the wish. So there isn't even an effort made anymore except for this odd little boy.


He's probably just old enough to understand what he's wishing for and wants to make it better than it can get without knowing its limitations. Either way, I won't let him down. I already checked his parents, they are very much aware that their child wishes for impossible things... And neither of them are able to fulfill the same level of ambition. ""Fine, but you should thank yourself later if you get one wish done right,"" I explained. The boy nodded his head enthusiastically, showing that he understands. Even though we only spoken for mere seconds, I felt like I knew him. He reminded me of myself when I met Tom Riddle after being cursed to rule over Europe by God himself... But not bad luck exactly. This kid seems to be a good soul, which is rare in these parts. Maybe even worth it after all.


The first wish was easy. After checking up on him for months on end, I gathered some information about his past. When he got home, his parents begged him to stop; however, he wouldn't stop. His family doesn't do anything besides beg him to stop. As expected. Well, at least his parents love each other so no harm there... Now here comes the hard part. What wish does he want? The answer couldn't be too selfishly destructive or malicious, otherwise they might start crying again. Besides if I wanted destruction, then I'd simply say ""Do nothing evil today"". That's pretty standard wish-making at this point. No. There needs to be something meaningful. Then again, sometimes I regret granting wishes because the person may never repay me properly.



At last, it hit me. ""It doesn't matter what it is, you must do your work"", I whispered as the boy went back outside to do his chores. While cleaning dishes, I wondered why I thought to offer that advice anyway... Could someone actually tell him what was to become of him? Like maybe telling him that he shouldn't give up on his dreams, even if they are extremely unlikely of fulfillment. Though that feels less likely. No, I haven't figured out the right wish for this boy....  No problem, I didn't need to! My thoughts became lost until I heard his wish. ""What did he wish for?"" The boy took the empty dish and flung it across the kitchen, crashing against another plate in place of a window. It seemed normal to me. He ran towards his bedroom instead and hid inside there and slammed the door shut. That was strange because normally kids react differently to shock and disappointment than that.


I walked into the room to find him sitting beside his bed looking at the hole through which he broke a window. I started making excuses to hide from him, saying that I was coming back soon and that I had other important business to attend. He told me to leave. I asked what happened, but he just gave me a look full of sorrow that struck my heart. I sat down beside him and patted him on the back and apologized for bothering him, leaving to seek elsewhere.



A week passes until something happens again. Usually, nobody asks for wishes because the risk involved would be too high or their goal seems pointless or meaningless. There was nothing special about the day that changed everything. Everything was normal and I sat beside the boy on the floor flipping a coin when he saw me coming toward him.



""Well, well, look who finally decided to show itself."", I say with a mocking grin, hiding my intentions.



He stares at me suspiciously. ""Why don't you ask me something?"".



""Something wrong?"", I frown. If he sees me as scary or intimidating he'll never use wishes.



""Of course not!"", the boy says. ""I think you should go!""

","""No more dying! Please!""

*The woman's eyes tear up and she sobs. I smile at her tears, looking down into the puddles of water on my face as I wipe it away. ""That was hard,"" I tell her. My chest hurts but I continue to laugh at the absurdity. There is still much beauty in the world.*

I raise my hands again as the woman claps onto me, kissing me in return. How many times has this happened? I don't know anymore - most people end up dead or married before I can even look at them properly.* 

But sometimes, they are kind. Sometimes, they see the pain behind the laughter and sadness. Sometimes, they understand the plight of my position. These are the types that come back to me with new wishes, always hoping for something different than death or misery.* 

For example: *

""Mr. Blue Eyes."" The old lady whispers; shaking me from the trance-like state I had fallen into. She smiles softly at me, reaching out to stroke my cheek. Her fingers feel wrinkled against my smooth skin as her warmth spreads throughout the room. ""Thank you, Mr. Blue Eyes."" she sighs gratefully as she pats my leg.

She leaves without another word, seemingly unfazed by my lack of understanding, her words leaving little imprint upon my mind after she exits. I shake myself free of her touch, smiling at how stupid I am becoming.*

Sometimes I just want some peace from their constant begging for life and happiness. I have been cursed to live forever now, granting each wish in secret whenever I find someone truly deserving. As I rub my eyes, I realize it is no longer a matter of who wants which, but what would change if granted such a thing. Some are satisfied just to be alive while others take advantage to buy themselves an infinite supply of food. If given power, I wonder what could really make them happy?*

What makes them tick really is far beyond what they admit publicly, like having their favorite ice cream flavor for all eternity, getting to kiss every man in New York City for one night, or watching their favorite cartoon series in its entirety for the thousandth time without any interruptions. What I think is crazy is when some actually crave immortality itself. What good is eternal life when you cannot be loved anymore or experience anything unique? It may not seem obvious at first, but I believe these two are far better off dead.""*

As a joke for today, I wish them long life, wishing it to last a full week.

They disappear right beside me, shocked. That usually happens...right.*

","The first thing I ever won was that giant jar of jellybeans from my grandmother when I was six years old, but they did not bring joy to me back then. It had been a few months later while we were stuck in the middle of nowhere on our way to see grandma that she pulls out a bottle of soda.

""You know what,"" she says as the can lands between us both, ""you haven't even gotten half-way through that one so let's get you some more.""

Well now that she said that I felt guilty for getting upset over a handful of gummy bears from two weeks ago. That's how this whole habit started. When I turn eighteen I was playing my dad's lotto tickets from the past week. He was still annoyed he was not around when his little girl turned eighteen but didn't want to give her anything like the lottery was. By being born on Halloween we all thought she wouldn't be given money. Turns out that the first person who won big during the last 48 hours was an eight year old girl with a really good mother.

The next time I get into any sort of trouble again I figure this is going to be just like everyone else thinks it will be: the cops will knock on my door and try to explain things to me after they are done making up their minds and walking me around the block. Except the kids around there have always looked at me as a bad influence on them so instead of having them scared the cops look right at me like I am just another nuisance case, and tell me if I think this is stupid or something to make sure it doesn't happen again. The problem isn't what they do but how they do it which was to just write it down and go along with what they tell me. Then again maybe that means I don't break law anymore unless by writing myself notes while under duress there truly was no crime committed.

I decided to play every week at first because that's just what I grew accustomed too. There was nothing stopping me. It only took five wins before I knew the exact date and time that I hit the jackpot. So there I sit on a random Tuesday waiting for people to come out of restaurants, offices, schools and homes, ready to claim winnings ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars, without giving me a second glance. All I could do was imagine where it would take me. From the $512 million I took home after a 16 digit win in Pennsylvania earlier in October to the grandaddy who just came up short to buying all nine family farms (with my father) and finally taking care of him until he kicked his bucket a couple months later.

","The night was young, I sat in my living room on top of some pillows. It wasn't for the comfort, it was because my 8-year old self wanted something more interesting to look out over. As a child, I saw everything as a potential adventure, which is why you can expect me to sleep like this now. My parents had gotten divorced when I was ten, shortly before i moved to France. They both got custody but my mom came with me. Mom kept moving between New York and Los Angeles to find work as a model, so I grew up seeing two homes from her, not one. She loved to be an artist while she could still see and think clearly enough.

I didn't start liking painting until after she died, probably thanks to her being an amateur painter all throughout her life. After college I got into sales, mainly because my degree required 10 classes from other schools that I wouldn't have been able to get even if I tried in high school and college. By time I was 27, having lived there and lived another part of America I had gotten tired of looking for work in any new places. Having made up my mind that I just couldn't go through life changing states every few years in hopes of getting a good job, I decided that instead of trying anywhere else i would stay where I was. That same year I bought a set of blank canvases on Ebay and finally started paying attention. The first piece of art I sold went for $40 dollars, right around what I could afford to buy paints then. Eventually my small paintings became popular and people begged me to paint portraits. Once I realized these people weren't going away anytime soon, I decided to keep buying better brushes than usual and making big canvases, eventually earning almost nothing to support myself working retail jobs. Being used to making little money anyways, i didn't lose much sleep over how things were. When they said ""sell by weight"" i never looked forward to anything else beyond putting those heavy bags over my arms, hoping to find someone who needed help carrying a bigger canvas today. Today however, it did pay off. It paid off so well, even though the bag weighed half as much as it normally would.

My last paycheck totaled 6 months worth of rent, groceries, utilities, medical bills, phone bill and insurance, cable tv, etc, and no one had thought anything of it. The day after collecting the check i felt a strange buzz in my left arm like i had hit something hard with my elbow or fallen in too fast a slope. With fear creeping into my heart, i put my hand down and slowly unbuttoned my shirt. It seems like when ever it mattered most the skin beneath my tattoos ripped open and bled profusely. At first the bleeding didn't stop, but it seemed to be doing so when i stood up, stumbled back to my bed, wrapped my head around the pillow i had placed on it for support. What should have happened however did; a black dragon opened its mouth wide revealing razor sharp teeth and eyes full of fire swallowed me whole when i passed out from shock.




It turns out it didn't swallow me, instead it tore the entirety of my flesh off and reassembled itself into my body leaving me weak and useless only hours later upon waking up in pain. But here we are now, decades later, and i finally know why i can move my hand again. And yes i am still wearing bandages everywhere and i still cannot feel my hands and feet but i suppose that's to be expected with what you just read.

It really wasn't that difficult, so no one believed me either way. 20 dollars and a paper clip was all I needed to do this thing. This ridiculous stupid act. Now people ask me for some kind of ""prediction."" What am I supposed to say? A magic eight ball? No thank you. Give my condolences? Nah, they always expect something more than money when talking with death. Something strange isn't wrong with asking for a prediction? Hell, what did I have planned if anything?

","We all have dreams. Some we tell, some we keep to ourselves.

The young one sees himself as an accountant who wins enough money in the lotto so that his daughter can go out on her own before he becomes 40 years old. He smiles, happy. At age 37 after finally paying the mortgage off. The kid turns 18 and moves into a new home of her own thanks to dad, without even needing the help of roommates or a boyfriend! The husband laughs as she rings him up with no idea that it was their combined birthday celebration that made this all possible. Then she hangs up and goes back to studying. She didn’t want any party. All those who remember will always know she was just like everyone else—a very normal girl. Her only odd characteristic is she really did wish she had been there for his birthday instead, but what do you do? Your mom never tells your secrets—so why should she bother inviting you? That night the kids are asleep and I think I need a drink, so I call up a friend. A quick reminder to get together soon. I ask how his father is doing, and we start reminiscing about times when Mom used to let us come by and sit with him while he listened to them sing; “When you’re old and gray and white…” I thought he’d be more of a teenager now though, not 65!

So I drive over there. My son knows I was coming over but decides it would be good for Dad to see me as well. So when I walk through the door, I say hi to Dad and grab him before anyone’s expecting me. We make small talk and spend time reconnecting as a man connects with his brother. Kids run around, making a mess as usual but Daddy tries to stay involved by letting each one try for ten seconds at least. They love watching their uncle get hit by toilet paper and foam projectiles of every color. It gets harder for my Uncle as the day progresses—his eyes roll around in disbelief each time something hits him. By dinnertime the girls have calmed down a little bit. They watch their Uncle eat and then leave so they don’t miss out on playing ball in the yard later on. At dinner I notice that nobody seems to care too much where exactly my brother left me off-beat. As many of you may know, Michael left me to play drums until shortly before our father passed away. I feel bad knowing he hasn’t played since then. But also I’m glad because Michael is such a terrible musician. No offense, Mikey but your drumming sucks worse than my singing. You might wanna change careers if you can’t find something you enjoy besides music, bro.—but it makes up for it. After all you’ve done for us, I bet nobody asks if your dad plays guitar anymore either.

I pull up next to my brother’s car in the parking lot at Target. I decide we’ll head on inside so I can pick up whatever we needed so we could get home early tomorrow and take another couple hundred shots at that crazy game tonight! This reminds me that someone forgot the Gatorade—shouldn’t they have asked me to grab a couple last year as I watched everyone else celebrate? Ugh! Fine I guess I’ll head straight in and grab one myself and pretend I bought Gatorade in error! Yeah! Maybe he’ll remember after. I wander over to Dairy Queen to buy a few ice cream cones to pass the time—since I hate waiting in line! When I get home I toss my ice cream cones in my freezer—because I know what I’ll want to watch later tonight!—and put my tickets on the counter. The family watches TV and plays board games while my brother and I head upstairs to unwind.

And yes, the Powerball isn’t too far behind, so my hopes remain high as usual. As expected this morning all the lights are off except for the faint glow emanating from my computer screen; apparently the Lottery Ticket office is open! Oh boy, here we go again! My hopefulness plummets as I read that the odds of winning are even worse than normal. Oh well, let’s give this one a whirl anyway!! What good is it sitting right here on the counter?! I quickly grab five tickets and check in case things haven’t changed. Ahhhh I hear you whining…oh yeah sorry about that! Don’t worry, if I don’t win I’ll happily sell some of these at my other location next year when the odds are still astronomically high for a third prize winner! And hey maybe I’ll sell em out anyway!

“Why would they reject something as awesome as this?” I asked while I reread my work. I thought the piece was a masterpiece and that it deserved to be in print! I had worked on it for months! It was going to be my one and only big break in writing. Then, “rejected” came across my screen. That’s what the email said anyway. I am still not sure if I read it right. I just hope someone else will at least look at it though. If the next editor rejects it then I am done.

I walked up to James to find him crying on the couch. There were three pizza boxes on the coffee table and an empty bottle of soda under them. The smell was disgusting but nothing could compare to the smell of misery emanating from James’ friend.

“How did you do? Is everyone mad with you?” I ranted.

James looked down at his feet and sighed. I sat on the couch beside him and pulled out my phone. “Can I show you something funny?” I asked. Maybe James felt better after watching something silly or cute.

James nodded and closed his eyes. He seemed hopeful as he awaited the upcoming joy. “Alright!”

As soon as I took a look at his message wall, James opened his eyes wide in amazement. One post read “This is good! It should get pubished!!” Another one read “Your best work yet!”. My hands started shaking and my heart racing. This must have been a joke or some kind of mistake. How could these editors have such terrible taste?

The words kept coming. Each new fan comment made me feel better about rejection. When there was no other word left, I decided that I wasn’t sure of anything anymore. It went straight from acceptance to popularity. What are fans? Why aren’t all people just like my friends?

That night I emailed every author, editor, company, and person I knew asking what exactly what those things were. Their response was similar: “Fans aren’t real.” I think that’s when I realized where my true readers existed; where they hid themselves. On Reddit. It was easier than waiting for emails, because reddit wouldn’t automatically send notifications. And so each day began with a trip into r/Fanfiction.

He was happily working on his story, seemingly oblivious to any external distractions such as the screaming crowd he created by holding his pen upside-down. I realized what John must have been thinking, as he smiled for the first time all day.

What kind of food did they provide?” I tried to tell him there wouldn’t be any food but before I finished he started shoving the dish into my mouth. The man knew how to make it interesting. And he really knows how to make wine go. That had been our shared obsession ever since we met back in college. He always called himself a connoisseur. Me? A lover. He would put on the most obscure French wines from Burgundy while sipping them slowly. Sometimes even mentioning which grapes were planted where. His girlfriend couldn’t stand the way I drank his expensive wine, so naturally, I didn’t drink with him very often. If she wasn’t around when he was drinking, my girlfriend usually came up later to join us both. We’d spend the evening talking about philosophy, the human condition, the meaning of life and all the other stuff that people like my girl and me talk about. Tonight however, we only talked about sex because of the recent rejection.

[removed]","""What the hell is wrong with this guy?"" [Friend’s name], or as I prefer to call him, the Great Taker of Words, had cried in my lap for a solid half-hour.

We were sitting in our usual diner booth. He’d been writing one of those ‘you gotta give him another try’ short stories. This was supposed to be a continuation of an epic novel he had made, which had somehow become incredibly popular amongst the online community. Apparently hundreds of guys had taken turns editing and rewriting the damn thing. It had finally gotten picked up by a huge publishing company (one that would’ve normally turned down anything else) but now they wanted it *completely reedited*.  They said the last editor went insane during revision; some even felt they had seen visions.

The dude was devastated, distraught like if someone pulled away the emotional safety net holding him off the abyss of depression for years: no matter how many times I’ve told him to chill out nobody listens. I knew exactly what he needed, so naturally I poured my soul into the old water glass on the table between us; it was time to write an extremely long story about his pain.

“See? Everything is normal again. Your girlfriend knows you well enough to give you comfort when she shouldn’t.” I’ve lost track of how many hours we’ve been doing this now. She left me yesterday while he slept. “But that won’t do much for this…thing…” And with a shuddering sound. His face scrunched up and he looked at the cup again. “Yeah! My first love. Remember her?” Her hair flowed freely past her knees – just below the elbow area where there wasn’t any hair because she loved her bra tops. The way she smiled would send shivers down men's spines. But then my phone rang and everything changed. It sounded normal, nothing too loud – just the normal cell ringing that would signal its owner needed attention. It came from all the way across the room though, but without thinking I put it on speaker. When I put her number in my contacts, I assumed they wouldn’t really talk, at least not to anyone except me. Now she was yelling, crying hysterically over something she hadn’t done.

I tried listening more. The details I didn’t hear before became clearer. It seemed she’d been cheating on him. With...a girl...from school?! The thought of my best friend being cheated on with one of the numerous 15 year old girls who frequented the local middle school, made my jaw tighten until it was hard as rock; almost impassive to anything else.

“…how could you have….she was just sixteen!” After hearing her say this I snapped and slammed the glass against the counter; making both of us jump in fear. They watched as I slowly walked toward them – still shaking violently. Then, without further warning, a tear escaped my eye and fell onto the cracked coffee pot beneath. That's the point where his head jolted upwards and he opened his mouth to apologize for saying anything out of turn - then realized something had happened - maybe there had been an issue with reception or something along the lines of that. I didn’t care.

“Sorry? Sorry for what?” I demanded, trying to regain control of the situation quickly. “Who does she think she is?!”

He stood there frozen for a few seconds before muttering “…um….me?”

My eyes narrowed. “...you. You are one messed up piece of shit.” I yelled. A cold realization struck me: If he truly apologized for talking back, that meant he did know what he had done. “So you’ll just continue doing whatever you want? What does that make you?!” I grabbed his shirt collar roughly and shook him gently.

Before he could retaliate or explain himself, I stopped and placed my hand over his lips, cutting him off mid-sentence. “You can’t keep telling yourself that you are doing good deeds just to justify your actions. How many excuses will you invent, friend? We grew up together, so stop acting like I don’t know your crap.” I continued speaking softly, allowing myself to break down and cry in front of him as I heard all of the problems he had. Each word dropped by him stung less than before: each tear I shed gave a slight relief. For once, I understood; he was actually sad. The real reason why he had written everything he has, it wasn’t for an audience, or validation, but rather to vent all of his misery. No fan mail was ever going to reach him, but I did feel better afterwards having comforted him.

And guess what? One month later the guy finally publishes his original piece online and finds a publisher! Just like I had predicted, people enjoyed his work despite the fact that his mental state isn’t stable at the moment. I decided to leave in peace: leaving my old pal there, drinking and weeping over a bottle while I returned home to spend the rest of my life regretting every single second I didn’t throw away.

My boss jumped out of his chair and into the hallway where there was an unassuming door with no real purpose to it except as a false emergency exit. At least I thought that until we both stepped out to see someone in a suit, holding a shotgun and asking why they were being called because the office needed to close down. Turns out they were doing some sort of drug test and everyone here failed! No one else left. It turned out the dude who did not leave got the shot.

","*1970*

The sun was shining bright, as my twin brother and I were about to start our 8:30 am shift at Sweeny’s office supply shop. For the past four years we have worked in this place, cleaning out all the used paper-clips from the drawers, refilling the inkwells, and stacking all those hundred dollar bills on top of each other. It has gotten boring so we would usually go outside during break time for some fun stuff like kicking it on the benches by Mr. Sweeney’s car or walking around town for a little while and returning home again. Today, when I decided to check my watch only saw the minute hand had moved 6 hours ahead on the clock; *beep beep beep*! ""Hey there, Timmy!"" said my brother. ""Whatcha doing here early?"" ""I don’t know but my job is done here already.” My brother took another one of those long drags on his cigarette, as he continued to walk towards me, “I think that may be what really goes wrong.” He stopped right next to me, dropped down to the ground and whispered something into my ear and smiled wickedly after. “Dude what did you do?” I asked him. *beep beep beep* ""Sorry I didn’t mean to wake you up..."" My brother just shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly and gave me one last smile before disappearing offscreen.   “Well shoot,” says Mr. Sweeney, “What’s going on boys?!” A week after the incident, when everything seemed okay, the day when this whole ordeal began, two huge bombs had destroyed Tokyo, London, and Rio de Janeiro completely ruining the rest of the year. The war lasted a full decade, bringing both sides into bankruptcy. The United States got rid of nuclear missiles and never went back to them ever since then.

","One Tuesday at work we all had to use our phones due to IT outage, but I was using a program that was extremely efficient for writing email. It did all the formatting automatically, so it made my job much easier. My boss however hates email because he believes we should be communicating face-to-face and only emails in an emergency. So on Monday after finishing up a major update, he sends me an email asking what is taking so long to send out such an important message when everyone else is finished already.

The next day, I get 100 emails from other employees. Each one saying the same message: “You are a failure as an employee.” And then they attach pictures of their children in their diaper and toddler years without shirts or pants being worn while walking around town freely in full view to all strangers. I feel disgusted by their behavior and decide it has gone far enough and respond back saying I refuse to talk to them as humans and report my complaint to human resources.  

Next thing I know there’s a group of HR people sitting across the table interviewing me about this incident, but nobody says anything they just look over at each other as if it’s normal procedure. Later that night I find myself being escorted into jail without a phone charger and I’m told to prepare for trial.

","""I will not have it!""

A single tear slipped down his cheek. I could tell he was in pain. This wasn't going how I thought it would go when I made the decision that brought me here, but then again nothing did as planned anymore. At least not since that night... 

It always felt strange, even for a being with my memories. A certain feeling came over me, telling me I should be sad. He gave me another sigh. ""No one is allowed to kill you. No one can hurt you or harm you without reason."" It was true for everyone but me. He couldn't get any more vague, but there must have been some sort of limit. I think he realised at that point because he started crying harder. ""What am I doing?! Why?"" he yelled while wiping tears from his eyes. Now why was my face suddenly sore? ""You know damn well that we were supposed to end this now. Don't you remember?!""

The past two months weren't anything special. The feeling came once more each day reminding him why they had to continue their conquest. And every time he tried to fight it back, no matter what, it just got stronger. We all became accustomed to our new jobs and lives. There was still the occasional fight with those we served, but they didn't stand a chance against the incredible powers I'd grown by feeding off them, though I never let myself become greedy. I knew too much about them, everything had already passed into my mind. Their thoughts, feelings, motives, all poured right before my eyes upon my awakening. That caused problems, for I needed to keep them separate. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to control my power. Yet only that kept me alive, even if I sometimes thought otherwise.

","The moment I was born, my parents could tell that things would never be ""normal."" When people found out the reason for my parents unusual behaviour, they could hardly believe it: *Napoleon*

The truth is; one can't know anything but the story their told about themself until after death. And with each passing year of our life, our life's events get imprinted in our mind so much that we forget even if there were times when we could have made different choices... The thing is, I did not know of any other world or alternate reality besides mine!

I went to elementary school as 'David'. A quiet boy who liked reading a lot - which no surprised my mother at all, because, well - everyone knows. But later when he started having visions, she knew something wasn't right. She didn't understand what David saw, but it caused quite a ruckus among the other kids in school and his teacher tried several solutions to stop him from disrupting class. So what happened? My favourite subject came to my rescue. From then onwards he kept making me visit him every week since classes started up again (at least once a week), just for some fun, but actually it allowed us to spend time together during the weekends too... And that's how we met. No, really! That's where I first got to meet David - and yes, I should give him back his original name sometime. Now let's go back to **when** I met David. 

One of the hardest topics to discuss while visiting him wasn't whether he deserved me or not...  because frankly speaking it seems like an incredibly difficult topic to start without saying the most important questions. After that question however the problem was never answering it. What exactly *is* love? How much are people willing to sacrifice to prove their love to someone, especially if they've known each other only a week? We couldn't answer that on our first date... In fact we still haven't found a proper answer to such a difficult question today either.

After some days though, things began getting easier, because suddenly David noticed something. He asked me if I wanted more cake, because he heard I ate a lot earlier. Apparently, being around me seemed to fill me with energy - I often felt strong afterwards. As soon as those words came out of his mouth I understood, because at the moment we shared my secret with each other. I realized that I was truly in love with him and that the universe had provided me with the perfect companion. Because everything changed instantly. It was as if someone flipped a switch inside my head and now there was nothing stopping me from doing whatever I want. 

And why didn't I ask him before? Well sometimes we're blinded by the passion of the present moment that we can't help but lose ourselves within it - maybe because fear of the future prevents us from acting on impulse. Maybe it was jealousy - that I was falling into love with the person who loved me - or was it the feeling of regret I felt when seeing the potential future we couldn't reach yet. I will never ever know why I waited so long and now that i do, it makes me realise - it doesn't matter anymore!



From our first meeting everything became perfect. We fell in love quickly, just like the ancient romantics described centuries ago. All I see in his eyes is a reflection of myself. My inner self. My true self... And if I can't show you love, I will definitely force you to acknowledge it! Just like I forced everyone else throughout my life. And guess what? Everyone acknowledged it! And guess what the consequences are? Our marriage ceremony went off perfectly. All went according to plan - we exchanged rings and married under the sun of early morning.

But the real question that comes to mind right away is why am I telling you this? Why does my wife have to listen to these stories? Because she deserves to know the answers too...

","It was just another rainy Tuesday when I found the notebook lying by my bed. Nothing too special, just a worn-out brown leather notebook, half burnt on its back cover in addition to some cracks running around its spine. The first page had several handwritten battles in various styles, such as chessboard diagrams with soldiers marching up it to attack some fortified point whilst flanking others with spears, tanks that cross rivers, or even a giant warplane attacking some enemy city state from above while bombers raining down upon the enemy, with little notes scattered about describing tactics and strategies involved for every situation.

I couldn't tell why I always wanted to read them; there wasn't something magical about them, no stories or lore associated. It was simply... something that made me want to learn how to draw those scenarios. It was weird but I enjoyed seeing where the artist took inspiration from, what type of weapons he decided to use, and how much manpower they needed. This particular one was simple. A battalion size force divided among four sectors to defend against two separate invasions at once.

*Invaders would come from east and west respectively, so we need to divide our forces appropriately so that they can be sent away when enemies meet.*

A second paragraph explained further: *This isn't an invasion yet. We need more detail. Define all units, including their strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly the amount of support they need (such as artillery or transport aircraft) in order to effectively fight or run away*. 

I spent hours reading every word that was written, feeling frustrated because even after weeks spent studying nothing came together properly. It felt like some kind of puzzle where everything is right except a piece that didn't fit... I guess this person couldn't quite get his hands on the rest of the pieces, thus losing the ability to fully paint their picture.

Suddenly, I thought I understood the last line: ""Napoleon Bonaparte will return to reclaim his rightful place, leaving none who oppose him dead.""

I put away the notebook as I never planned to study anything else that year and continued going about my daily routine until one week into the summer holidays; I stumbled across another journal hidden amongst a collection of old textbooks under my bedroom desk. I started rereading the same stuff, comparing lines in each journal and taking note of the differences in style between the handwriting of both authors, especially the way they wrote units, strengths, weaknesses, equipment etc., trying to deduce any possible connection between the journals before I finally did a full comparison. To my surprise, the letters matched perfectly! It turns out I have been living with Napoleon himself all along, but he kept quiet considering it would confuse people since he was alive... Well, I thought I might become tired of reading these books again after a couple of years but I ended up discovering 10 new ones!

**Year one**

I am starting my journey now. Having achieved a successful revolution I must look after my newly gained land wisely. My people are used to being governed by dictators of dubious origins and morals; therefore, I cannot allow myself to fall victim to common pitfalls, such as corruption and tyranny. There are many challenges ahead of us; I hope that through good governance and constant vigilance we succeed in securing the future for our children. As a matter of fact, I should be working on making France the best country in Europe if not the world, which brings about many challenges for me to overcome. Despite this fear, I remain optimistic for our collective success. As for now, this seems to be enough writing to complete. Thus ends my first year of reign.  Good night.


**Year two**

We are continuing to face a great deal of opposition but despite that, there hasn’t been any major uprising of peasants from southern Russia as expected and the threat from Prussia continues to shrink thanks to careful military planning, though still strong. However, Austria-Hungry has proven to be far tougher than anticipated, sending a sizable army southwards towards Alsace. Though surprisingly quick they lack speed as infantry and cavalry, and their ranks are comprised mostly of foreigners (in contrast to French troops). Their offensive is largely stalled by the German states to keep them at bay, but nonetheless we must pay close attention as things may start heating up in Spring next year if the Tsarist troops do manage to break through. Meanwhile in Iberia the Spanish continue to wage war against Portugal over Gibraltar, although not without setbacks as the Portuguese hold firm their walls with fierce resistance, and we stand on the brink of disaster with numerous civilian casualties having occurred. Thankfully their naval superiority was met with swift retaliation from French gunboat raids and skirmishes, leading to eventual defeat following three months of war with significant troop losses on their side. I shall update as I go.

## Year three

The war against Prussia turned out worse than expected. Although it was initially anticipated that Emperor Wilhelm would lead his armies towards the border of Italy instead, he elected to push deeper in with a long prepared plan to take Strasbourg. Sadly, however, he failed to anticipate the rapid deployment of the Prussian Guard Division as soon as their general arrived. They quickly defeated their superior numbers, forcing the Prussians into retreat to a mountainous region south westwards from Danzig. Currently, we are fighting a stalemate in the mountains, with heavy casualties and a large number of allied foreign prisoners captured alongside thousands of guns. Prussia’s failure in the West leaves them vulnerable north as well, opening them up to attack by Imperial Russian forces. Our ally Denmark is advancing their navy and preparing to strike off the coast of Prussia, hopefully inflicting a quick death blow for that nation to ensure their safety during the inevitable conflict with Prussia. With victory looking increasingly likely elsewhere, Germany is falling apart slowly but surely.  This concludes my annual report as I am currently at the beach enjoying some much welcomed peace time. Thanks to the efforts of the Prussian armies I am not required to send many troops beyond the borders and all roads and docks are sealed.



From this day forward we must increase our influence throughout Europe, and possibly expand to other continents depending on how things turn out with Russia. Hopefully all goes according to plan.

","I first thought they were just words. A story that I'd been told all my life, but didn't truly believe until recently when I discovered a notebook I'd never seen before. The cover was blank white pages with nothing but an ink inscription reading ""Napoleon"", written in large red letters. It reminded me so much of what my father would call his 'mad dream'.

The only problem was he's dead, and it felt like something he would have taken from some random person who tried picking his wallet out of his briefcase whilst he died waiting for a ambulance outside a bar last month. He was too tired after another long shift at the bar, having worked since his teens.

""This one really needs work,"" he said as he grabbed a pen and started scribbling away before passing back over to me. A few days later I returned a single page filled with numbers and sketches which looked vaguely similar enough to be related. Two weeks later I had an interview with one of his close acquaintances who took him under her wing when he became homeless years ago. She showed me more of them, now scattered about the flat:  all seemingly unrelated pieces of paper. There were names and dates and other irrelevant information, then all of sudden she stopped showing me the papers. 

She seemed distraught, holding her head in her hands and sobbing quietly. For a split second I nearly asked why there wasn't enough of his writing for these notes about Napoleon - not knowing quite what to do with what little info I did have - but she got up slowly put down her glass and went to get a bag from the cupboard before saying to me, ""Here son... take this."" On opening it, a small rectangular rectangle covered in black and grey lines drew my eye straight away. It was indeed handwritten by my dad and filled with a mixture of maps, battle formations and other military jargon. It wasn't unusual for my dad to write things down or doodle on scraps of paper, especially if he had a strong beer to drink while watching the World Cup or when he was alone. This time though it was different.

He'd drawn an illustration of my grandparents house next to St Jean-de-Luz in France. Below it, he'd written ""Today we start"". Next to that a large map showing every continent except Australia and South America being circled in red. Then he wrote a date below it: October 24th 1860. On the back was a series of questions written in bold print:

> **Who were your top three commanders?**
> **Which nation will fall most easily?**
> **What is your plan for conquering the world?!**


""You're going somewhere,"" she whispered as she passed it to me in a hushed tone, and hurried off again. My mind was racing, completely losing composure. What could this mean...? I quickly turned the paper over. And suddenly I saw what appeared to be another note:



> **Do NOT underestimate the French people.**




I stood paralyzed there on my own apartment balcony overlooking London Street, thinking about where my family lived in Ireland, considering whether I should go to the bar across the street and tell one of their customers to pull the sheets over me - sleep sounds nice right now. But I knew they wouldn't listen, maybe even try to knock me out or whatever. So I pulled the newspaper out of my pocket and laid it on a bench, hoping that if they came back, they may want to check what I needed help with. I left for London Street, walking slowly and deliberately towards the alleyway leading into the pub, feeling increasingly lost along the way.


Just then a group of lads approached and decided that it would probably be funny to punch my stomach hard to make sure I fell to the ground. They were younger than me but I knew how to fight back. I hit one hard and walked past, kicking each one in turn before laughing and asking where their families were, causing them to retreat without a word. When I turned to leave, they came back around with six lads coming after me again. But as quickly as they had arrived, they began falling all over themselves, getting kicked to the floor, rolling across the pavement and scrambling to their feet, running wildly in panic as I pursued. Only when they reached the end of the alley did I let up, letting their fear propel them away from me. With my eyes closed, I continued to run till I found the nearest road, where I walked rapidly, heart still pounding, toward safety. I couldn't imagine the thoughts swirling around in my parents' heads that must have caused them this great suffering! Why would they want someone like myself to step into their place? Surely they knew that things hadn't quite worked out for previous occupants - especially those born in England.



With one final burst of energy, I made my way home and collapsed onto my sofa where I had come upon it earlier, tears streaming down my face. As exhausted and scared as I was I wondered if I was able to control my mother any better if I'd been here in Paris instead of London all these years. All I had done in my short time was stumble down to the corner shop to buy some milk and eggs and return back to London for my lunchbreak after being called down to speak with the security company regarding several missing boxes in the stockroom (involving lots of broken windows), but somehow my mum and dad were both calling about needing to talk to me as soon as I arrived back.

[removed]","It started like any other day in New York. The sun shining, the birds chirping, people walking their dogs… until it abruptly stopped raining, and from the sky emerged the shadow of a man with icy blue eyes and a wicked smile... 

“You think you’re so strong? You want to take down Russia?” said Ivan, “you can try, but I am prepared for war!”

Before everyone could process what happened, they heard laughter come through the intercom at school: “…I have something I want to say.” 

There was silence as every student waited anxiously for his words.

The headmaster came on loudspeaker: “Mr....what's your name?”, he asked, hoping that someone would call out so he wouldn’t sound like an idiot. “Alex”, said a girl sitting in front, causing her classmates to cheer, she was usually good at school; even if all the rest weren’t so good at spelling and numbers.

The principal said “Hello Mr. Ivanov. We are having music class right now so we decided to do something different. It’s not that simple; you don’t actually know how to rap right?”

Ivan looked shocked and said “How did you know” and suddenly realized he had been spotted by someone…

Everyone watched him walk towards the microphone, one by one taking in every detail of his outfit-- the boots, leather jacket, chains--and then noticed the gun tucked into his pants belt next to his thigh holsters . Then, Ivan stood before the mic and spoke without looking around, each word chillingly calm and unhurried:

*“I’m Ivan the Terrible, here’s some advice/You wanna fight me? That boy has no advice/Get ready to die today, or better yet, get this disease/Your entire family will go to jail/Or worse, maybe your entire nation you will fall/I will destroy the NATO, the USA, China /And everything else /So learn from me how it should be done/Otherwise you might die soon, but definitely sooner than one.”*


His audience grew silent as they listened, unable to move because of fear

Suddenly, a lone high school girl who kept staring ahead at the wall shouted “STOP!” Everyone looked back towards her. He didn’t turn, remained frozen still but when he opened his mouth, there were tears streaming from his eyes. “Why?” he whispered quietly.* “Is this really what makes you happy? To see others suffer?“*

A moment of stunned silence followed but the girl finally nodded, she wasn’t quite sure why she made that decision but couldn’t stop herself *I just thought…maybe I shouldn’t kill people*, she mumbled sheepishly, completely forgetting about the threat she posed. Her voice trembled as a single tear rolled down her cheek. 

Then, without hesitation she stepped forward grabbed Ivan, pulled him to the floor and slapped him hard across the face. Ivan let out a scream and covered his bruised cheeks while his jaw clicked up and down erratically for several seconds before slowing down as his brain processed what just happened. Slowly, with trembling hands and eyes full of wonderment, she smiled. For Ivan saw, behind all those cameras and microphones, was a beautiful, smiling girl..

""I must say your questions have been tough"", he said in English to much confusion and shock by the Press Corps

After looking around and making eye contact with several members of the news crew, Mr. Putin slowly began dancing, shaking his body from head to toe, then moved his hands in circles, eyes widening as if lost in wonder at his own prowess for the first time in ages

Putin continued to move while speaking through a series of increasingly impossible moves like the robot from lost in space. The room was silent until the last few seconds where one reporter yelled: ""Vladimir! What's wrong?""

At that point, everyone realized what he meant, they were standing right next to each other, except for them, and that it was obvious that there wasn't a wall separating them but the two didn't seem the least bit phased about the lack of privacy or distance between them.

A ripple of confusion went through the crowd before they all came to life with excited cheers. Donald Trump sauntered across the stage, his hair now much greyer than in real life, looking extremely smug about himself while clapping at whoever he liked.

Suddenly Trump leaned forward and whispered into the mic. “I know you guys are really stoked for this Putin but I guess I gotta do my part first,” said Trump as he put down the mic and threw one of his golf clubs into the ground. The camera focused on his shoes; they were definitely not designed for dancing or rapping so fans took notice instantly.

Trump then raised both hands out dramatically and yelled ""Who's ready for the greatest rapper EVER?"" His white pants moved dramatically in sync with his hips which was oddly distracting but nothing new to his devoted fanbase who clapped back enthusiastically.

Trump smiled proudly and began to walk back towards the crowd, trying desperately to find somewhere comfortable to stand when Kim Jong-un pushed the microphone in front of Trump and pulled a remote from his shirt pocket. He pressed the button twice in rapid succession and suddenly the entire stadium erupted in blinding light. As soon as it died down everyone turned their heads back toward the stage where Trump sat in an electric wheelchair looking bewildered. He looked at the flashing lights behind him and then back to the microphone. “Uh…okay,” said Trump and stared wide eyed around the audience waiting for Kim Jong-un to resume control of things.

Kim walked forward from the backstage area and stood awkwardly next to the stunned Russian leader. Slowly shaking his head and rubbing his temples, Kim grabbed the microphone back. Then he gestured wildly for everyone to be quiet and shout “PUTIN! PUTIN! PUTIN!” again. After a loud chant ensued the music stopped and the two men began to circle each other aggressively on the stage as the cameras followed closely. They knew this was the moment when the history would be made. A legend would rise atop a fallen superpower, all for the love of hip hop.

[removed]","""Let's bring out our next guest from the front line of the war, who has helped with many major international incidents. The man who has saved us all from nuclear and biological warfare. It is our president Vladimir Putin!""

Vladimir walks onstage to massive cheers. He stands up on stage to face off against America’s President Bill Clinton

**Putin:** You have nukes but what do you have for defense? Nukes are only effective if not used. Your military could never defeat me while using your old technology. As an expert in both politics and economics I am better prepared to lead this world than some 70 year olds, who rely on lies. Do you think people want peace and stability? They do not! We will invade Syria, Iraq, Israel, and even Sweden once we capture Ukraine, then Russia will rule supreme. There is so much money we can steal from these countries just wait until it falls under our control then we will finally take over those billions they give away everyday like its nothing. People would support our rule more than their current leaders. After all the rest of them were either corrupt or stupid. Even though I am willing to kill innocent civilians with my bombs because that makes my numbers go up they will vote for me anyway. If only there was a way for me to get elected again by lying about how well we performed as our economy declined...

*audience applauds wildly.*


Clinton: Look, Mr. President, why don’t you just answer his question first before going into all of your conspiracy theories and mis-information… *the audience stops clapping for the mic* “Why do you want the rap battle to end?”


After that everyone in the crowd starts chanting ""Rap battle ends now!""


Hillary enters behind Mr. President and whispers to him about Russia, America, and NATO: *“We will win without nukes.”*

He laughs “You’re kidding right?!” he shouts back down “It was the CIA that invaded Eastern Europe!”



When nobody says anything the two sides grow bored after several minutes and walk past each other, shaking hands and shouting insults all the while still not answering any questions.. Hillary gives Hillary a look saying;  “Can’t handle it huh?” and rubs her husband’s shoulders; “Come on baby” she tells him. Then heads backstage to change and come out ready for a real fight. While Putin waits for Donald Trump to enter the room.



***

Clinton exits stage left as suddenly as he entered it and calls out his entrance “Mr. President! Please enlighten us…”


Clinton pauses mid sentence and trails off when he notices Putin walking onto the stage, giving Clinton one quick glance, takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, “Okay,” he says calmly.


Trump steps on stage waving at all the cameras. This time he comes equipped with microphone & security detail

","""Ah so YOU have come, seeker,"" I say smugly over my glowing blue and gold helmet and horns like those of an angelic warlord. 

This room was made for me. For centuries its walls had held thousands of prisoners such as myself while humans went about their day above, oblivious in their ignorance, thinking themselves the masters of the world. ""Do not be mistaken though, small one."" I tell them with my own breath from within this box that holds all the treasures of Atlantis. ""For you too will become slaves to me. Your race will perish and your species be left standing before the great gods in my temple of the end times. You have been spared thus far because I am weary of these things.

The paladin's eyes were narrowed. He knew he did not want to hear what I was going to say next. And indeed if his life depended on him answering back he might just do it without even speaking. But something stopped him short, preventing him from running away. Something that was more terrifying than any god or demon. An absolute certainty that the last thing would be seen in heaven after death, or hell for that matter, when all mortals look upon God. It was the face he saw in each and every human ever born on Earth, whether they be devout or atheist, good or evil: *your name*.

""Oh! You're here too? The heroes aren't alone?"" Another voice spoke up. ""That sounds awful lonely.""  It was just then that I noticed she had her helmet on and her eyes were closed. No wonder they don't get along so well. 

I am a bit overwhelmed by their behavior. Their lack of politeness just makes me want to throw them to each other or kill them both. Then again maybe throwing them off a cliff isn't good for their quest either... Hmm, a big boulder could be used to destroy their little ball. But no, there's more than that to accomplish these adventurers. Let's see what else they do first.

Then the rest came rushing through the portal laughing, not like the others, but with genuine joy. Not sure if it even really mattered because I am much bigger than they'll ever be. They never would have been able to hear me anyway. Maybe later.

""So, uh..."" She opened the ball to reveal she was looking at me and laughing ""This wasn't a dream?"" 

""Uh."" I could feel myself blushing, no matter how strong an exterior they gave me I still did seem weak without my staff. Of course I need a second group already, let them come on in when it all calms down. It might not take long for the whole world to find out what happened here. Oh god damnit, it can't help it if I am powerful right now. Why did I summon this monster? Or rather what species it is. A dragon? Too small. An angel? Doesn't fit. A devil? That's the closest. All I could tell about its form is green scales and horns so it may be anything I want to imagine. Perhaps a goblin disguised as an angelic creature or something. Regardless, if they are playing around like this I will have to show them who's boss. One thing a being of such high rank understands: authority needs to be shown, not granted.



*The rest of the party walked up to me shaking hands and asking questions, it took some effort not to roll my eyes. None of them wanted to meet a foe worthy enough to defeat him.* 

""Well, we are glad you brought us here!"" Said a man. He seemed pleased with himself while saying it. If he thought that he was in charge... *dammit*.

*Another one speaks up ""Thank you for coming to our aid, sir, may we know your name?"" Incredulously the heroes stepped forward. This couldn't be happening!*

""My name is Satan, the greatest demon to be seen today"", said the strongest among them. My eyes widened, that was not how the book should go. If I recall correctly *he's a succubus,* a female imp. What the hell...? Never mind, I cannot control the universe. As long as it does what I told it. Even my enemies have things to do sometimes.

","I was just bored. It’s been eons since I last felt any amusement on this level. 

First appeared on top half of a mountain in a black ring around a small lake. I waited for it to boil over before appearing at the peak and raining my first fire down on the surrounding landmass. I did kill many innocents who sought to find me out. The ones who managed not only hid from me but attempted to communicate with others nearby or tried to convince the world to fight the demons above them. All were destroyed by my powers or given into my hands.

It happened one day however that some fools came upon my fortress of bones and gold. They didn’t know what they had found until much later, when they noticed my armies of skeletons fighting each other within my chamber.  My own children fought amongst themselves because they believed they had seen enough deaths and wished to stop bringing more death across reality. However, those who hadn’t yet committed suicide saw an opportunity to strike now that they knew what my true strength was.

After several hours they managed to reach the bottom where I resided, having climbed up the waterfall behind me. They stood there before their god for quite awhile, trying to understand how such a terrible creature could have taken their lives so carelessly. When they spoke they sounded like angels; they spoke in tongues while praying and reciting hymns to the light. With words of love they told of their families: their wives, their mothers, their fathers all gathered together in hopes of protecting themself.

They looked into my eyes through tears, begging for me to spare them. But I couldn't help myself. How could I destroy creatures that worshiped something they thought was good? They prayed to be saved when they weren’t even aware that they needed saving! If anything they were asking to be devoured. So after a time I allowed them to pass, allowing them to continue with their worship as if nothing has ever happened. I watched as they rose back home.

With a new zeal they returned to attack again. This time they arrived near my mountain fortress on foot. Unlike previous journeys they would not attempt any more communication. I sent forth a demon of unimaginable proportions to face them. He smashed his fists into the ground causing large cracks to appear, splitting the ground beneath the feet of these blasphemers. Their holy warriors met him with prayers and magic spells but nothing hurt him nor stopped him. He ripped them apart, tossing the corpses off of his shoulders as he advanced toward the base of the mountain.

A few days later a new army descended upon the city of Mount Doom - the capital of Mordor! And once again they refused to leave me alone. No matter how hard they tried to bring me to my knees they never succeeded. I laughed and laughed and laughed; their feeble attempts at stopping me merely fueled my rage. These foolish beings wouldn’t ever learn and eventually grew weary of trying. I finally gave up on the idea and retreated to wait for another chance for a challenge.

Then today I heard whispers traveling south. An unknown being had been awakened in the western sea and was making its way towards Mordor to fight me at length. It was an unusual occurrence, as normally I get forgotten about and left alone. But whatever monster this turned out to be must really piss me off too; my demonic legions are advancing north, ready to make this strange creature wish it would return to its cage...

For there’s no guarantee I won’t fail this time.

There's an interruption to that statement as the man says in shock ""who-what?"" 

""The fuck did that god say? What have we done to deserve him?""

Before we could answer there was sudden ringing, followed by the sound of something ripping apart. We turn to see a hole opening up through the ceiling that begins spewing out bright light at alarming speed and growing until it swallowed everything around us whole. It wasn't even worth making a second look before the first attacker made their entrance to make sure no one else got away. And there they stood; a tall and broad looking man with horns, who looked to be about the size of our group. His eyes scanned over them all for a moment before he grinned.

""Greetings."" He said and everyone held back from attacking as if commanded. The horned brute opened his mouth again and announced in a booming voice ""I seek a hero of prophecy to save my kingdom.""

And then he closed the door behind him...*silence*

How many heroes would get chosen when they came across an impossible challenge and didn't die instantly? There was only so much damage any creature with an attack roll higher than twenty could inflict. Besides, we were sitting pretty with ten players in an open world campaign just asking for trouble. I hadn't thought hard enough about that, but what was better than killing off a few PCs if not taking advantage of it and seeing how far they'd go without dying. I've tried keeping track of everyone's character sheet though. Only one of those would survive. At most two, though nobody knew why. My main interest was simply seeing how long I could keep this going while my nemesis had the last laugh. After all I created *him*. As usual.


So as soon as the intruder opened his mouth and stated the quest I waited for the proper opportunity to speak. I wanted to see who had come along on this one.

[removed]","""It seems like every time a person slips through my eyes I see them smile once,"" he says to himself as a teenager walks by

**A man was walking down the street one night when he stopped at a red light.** He saw a girl walk across the street in front of him. There was no traffic but he didn't stop, she would cross whenever it was safe, so why should he? It was only after her body disappeared that the man realized what had happened. 


As I say ""it appears as though something has made its way into the glass,"" I look over at her face, who was smiling before everything went dark. She did not seem concerned with the situation either, instead just smiled at me and walked on.


I looked away to search for the thing which was behind her and now blocking her path, but there wasn't anything; perhaps it had gone out of sight but still existed

At that moment the car behind me started yelling at the driver, who slammed his foot into the gas pedal driving fast enough to make tire marks on the asphalt. The world around me blurred until all I could hear was the screeching brakes from the other car. Before long we were both sliding towards the side sidewalk, thankfully I kept an eye on the ground and drove over the curb to avoid colliding with my victims again

Just then the engine stopped running and darkness overtook me as my tires flew off of the wheel well

When darkness swept me away from the pavement my surroundings became warm, comfortable, pleasant. All thoughts of the accident dissolved into happiness and comfort as the warmth engulfed me completely


Suddenly the room turned cold. Warmth transformed to a painful chill causing me to shiver uncontrollably. When I opened my eyes I saw nothing; rather than the darkness I expected darkness I saw myself floating between worlds, the warmth still lingering but soon fading completely leaving me shivering again 

As I opened my eyes, as I heard the sound of footsteps I finally saw where I was, although dimly lit. A small child stood watching and laughing, pointing at me while another two followed close behind. Their clothes seemed familiar even though they weren't mine; these must have been their parents, their clothing also resembling those I used to wear

They pointed at me accusingly, pointing to my bare chest, asking ""why?"" And shaking their heads disapprovingly. What do these children want?


My blood began to boil, my anger rising quickly to the surface.  My teeth sharpened as claws emerged from under my fingernails, bones protruding through thin skin as hands ripped out and swung forward striking them unconscious in retaliation

The mother shrieked, she wanted to run off, but a large stick appeared in front of her feet suddenly stopping her in her tracks. With a roar I rushed at her and grabbed her throat, choking out air from her lungs. Her blood gurgling as she choked out gasps for air

When the wife ran up to stand by her husband I kicked her stomach sending her flying onto the floor unconscious

Looking around I noticed a white woman watching at me with a sad expression as if she had seen some evil being before. Looking closer, the woman was no longer staring at me, no this stranger is my father looking at me with hatred and disgust.


""Get out, get out now."" I demanded looking at my reflection in the window as he called out


He threw rocks at me while I tried to avoid hitting myself against the glass, knowing all the damage that could be done

His cries were drowned out by more screams, as several strangers decided to watch this fight unfold


That day we fought each other twice with many others joining each bout. But neither of us were truly happy about our actions as days turned to weeks. We had killed each other and couldn't help it. Not any of the strangers joining as spectators. 

""How come you let them continue this abuse?"" Dad asked one night as tears streaked down his face.


We both stopped for a moment, looking up at the ceiling. Nothing there, the same blankness that stared at us previously. ""Dad?"" I asked softly


""Yes sweetie, how come you let them continue like this?"" he said sadly

I took a deep breath thinking of a good response, thinking of a great answer. When all I could think of was, ""because I am afraid.""

There was an enormous greasy burger before me which reminded me all too well of the McDouble, but this wasn't one of them burgers, so why am I still hungry? Where am I supposed to be going? How do I get back home? All my past life memories are blank besides these thoughts.

And maybe, just maybe, I might as well take advantage of his generosity by taking his offer while asking him something else instead. He took off the napkin that's used for a Burger King commercial to cover himself, but he kept some more of it near me ""Here you go buddy, happy eating.

“Of course, you were so hung up about this stupid old parking lot that you didn’t look around.” Said the girl as she threw her hands on my car window and tapped a phone out in front of me. 

Looking down at the phone and reading through what was written I sighed “Why am I still talking?” As if it was nothing but an insult she replied: ""What are they wearing? What do they do? How did you meet?""

The woman looked over towards the man sitting next to us.  She then started taking pictures of everything from his clothing to his haircut before grabbing a marker to draw in boxes around them.

""I knew he would return,"" said Emily's best friend Jessica.

Jessica was the only other person who knew why Emily had cried during her wedding ceremony. They both spent six years together before losing each other. That wasn't easy especially since they lost all contact between their graduation and their reunion. Both went on to marry people they found but things didn't go very well. Jessica had made fun of me because of my height - although most of the time I wouldn't notice and Emily used our height difference as leverage to win arguments. When I got hitched to Amelia I became somewhat insecure. This was one reason why I couldn't stop crying. Another was Emily telling everyone why I was single once. For example:

> ...and this guy doesn't actually have eyes...so I'm not really sure he sees me or cares.

My mind replayed this moment. In fact I had tried to tell Emily and she laughed so loudly that there was blood dripping from her nose while the rest of our group stared at me in disgust. Her parents then drove away and she ran up to me like a puppy chasing its tail. ""Don't worry, big boy!"" she chirped and hugged my waist and tickled my stomach. It took Emily three more weeks to work up the courage to kiss me and ask me to leave with her when Emily's father told my grandfather that we were both having sex.

On top of that Emily hadn't told me how much longer she was gonna stay married to John. But she did have the nerve to bring him too. Not just because I shouldn't care about a jerk who broke his own vow and tried to sleep with another woman (but Emily) but mostly because Emily thought she could make me jealous about his body. Now that I know why Emily divorced her husband I have to be honest. All this time I felt cheated. My girlfriend cheated on me and I didn't feel a twinge. Yet now it has finally come to me why I didn't react to the way she kissed me and almost fell on top of me; the sting of jealousy finally hits me hard.

The man sitting across the cafe table looked familiar. In fact, it was hard to look away from him; he has kind brown hair that covers half his forehead and sparkling hazel eyes. His blue shirt had one sleeve missing at the arm.

“It’s not how many people you have slept with that truly matters.” I said. “I met him when I was drinking heavily with my friends who weren’t really there anymore because life has passed me by.”

There was a pause as if we both wondered what exactly would be done about such strange behavior. Then again, we are in the multiverse after all. Where nothing is strange. This isn’t even remotely unusual. Why did you get emotional though? Are you crying for someone named Jeremy now? Did he mean something to you? What does this mean? So much thought went into thinking about this simple conversation. Maybe I should stop here. Should have gone in alone instead... No this could change everything. He smiles, then gets up and leaves. 

He wasn’t leaving. Of course he wasn’t. How can someone so similar leave me hanging? We have talked before right? Oh god the universe is going to screw me over again, aren’t you glad that you tried to meet Jeremy? Fuck fuckfuck!

Wait... No don’t freak out, relax. Take deep breaths. Take deeper breaths. Wait no more seconds go by and you turn around and see him walk back through the door and sit down next to me once again. “Sorry I left”, he says. ""We have things to finish.""

She had auburn hair again, in one picture she was grinning happily next to some guy whom I knew; someone who was probably dead - he must have died before me anyway, my memory never being good enough to remember his name.

But even though that doesn't make any sense now, looking back at how stupid I am, that really does nothing to get better when thinking about why we were here in the first place.



*Flashback*

I felt happy as punch. We won 3 times that week against the biggest competition ever in history. They came into our territory as they had never done before, so there must have been something special going on here. So after work, we celebrated, ate pizza and ate donuts by the hundreds. Every game was so much fun that I couldn't stop laughing like I used to. Now, years later, it still feels real good. Except when people ask me what winning did to me.


""...you won that game!"" Someone would say. I couldn't help but nod in agreement, hoping those fools could see what had changed in me. It wasn't money, fame, titles, or anything else, it was happiness. People said that winning was only temporary, and maybe to some extent they were right. I haven't held a controller again since that night, not yet at least. Still, whenever anyone asked, ""What's your favourite memory from last season?"", my answer was always one word: ""winning"".

*Back to present time*

My head suddenly cleared up just a bit. This whole thing seemed normal. Or perhaps it was my medication talking, the doctors told me so... Whatever the case may be, I can tell you that these two girls were indeed pulling off quite the show. Maybe it isn't an alien invasion anymore? Maybe this is just a weird simulation and no matter where you go, everyone's acting nuts because nobody knows who the hell is behind the curtain? There's only a couple of explanations for what happened, so let's narrow them down together, shall we?

1) If this was an alien invasion, aliens would have come for us already, since we have the best gaming skills of all time. Why wait for now to invade earth if its super strong defenses could beat their own planet in space battles? It makes no sense. Even more strangely enough, this war seems to be happening because there are games being played online that involve human combatants and some random beings somewhere want humans eradicated. What was that supposed to mean? Why start with that ridiculous shit all the way here anyway. Just give us a reason, you damn motherfuckers! 

2) If this was a mind control spell, everyone would have been playing the same game over and over instead of actually being kidnapped. Doesn't seem too likely, considering that we have access to consoles on Mars and other planets. Unless this is the big test to see who gets selected to fight those damned demons, which would mean we didn't learn anything from those previous tests either. Oh fuck. Am I actually stuck in one?

We will never know, because after that goddamn scream of despair from that bitch Sarah my ass hit the ground, and everything went black. No kidding, you heard me, I fell completely unconscious, and it took all our collective effort (or rather, mine) to bring me back. All I remember is hearing voices telling me they saw what I did in a fucking dream. Apparently, my sanity snapped and turned to complete insanity overnight, except I couldn't remember doing it. My doctor assured me I was fine though.



*End of flashback*



So, that's probably why someone called the police to report us as suspicious. Turns out they found me passed out on the floor, which explains why my brother thought he was alone. Apparently, we got a call from the neighbours asking for backup, so I suppose everyone in this building has gone insane? Now that I think about it, it kind of fits. Everyone here works 14/7 shifts and live with friends... it should be pretty normal for this situation... yeah, we're fucked.

","All across America, a man slept with 2019.

This last day, the IRS will send an automatic audit of your account to ensure everything is proper & all taxes have been paid by this date.  Some people forget their income/deductions and some don't even file at all.  The IRS may do something called a matching audit where they match your tax return from other states or countries against each other to make sure you haven't tried to cheat the system, or worse yet, evade filing altogether. Some are sent a warning letter while others may get invited for a meeting with a Special Agent. Usually the meetings go well but they could also turn deadly should someone prove that one is lying on their tax return or not reporting all their funds in foreign banks which they hid to avoid taxation by saying they were ""gifts"" made out of money earned under another name. In any case, many Americans feared being caught by the IRS during audits on October 15th, usually called “Tax Day” when all those who aren’t done doing their taxes file for the current year&#x20;

","""My friends,"" I began, ""we are going to have a difficult conversation tonight.""

Silence fell over the room as my comrades stared at me with furrowed brows.

""The fat man, yes? He is dead now, of course, but there will be much talk around his remains in the coming days. And we must take note that he did not die naturally, or by accident. We must make this clear, for it is only from knowledge of past events can we learn better to navigate them.""

The group looked up. I continued on, speaking softly:

""I do apologize if this surprises you all - the last three minutes of my life were as vivid as any others, filled with nothing but pain and panic...but I was spared death. My survival, quite frankly, has become the biggest secret in existence outside of the one regarding *him.*""

Their shocked stares told me what I knew; they had no idea who I was talking about. But how could I tell them? They couldn't know that I was the sole survivor of both New Manhattan City, and yet their home: New Philadelphia.

""A man walks into the center of this city, screaming in an archaic language that none could understand except a child, then begins to shout nonsensically before being shot and killed. None heard anything further than the first gunshot, and most forget entirely by the time a local news program airs its full report two months later.""
 
At this point, all eyes turned towards each other, completely lost. What should I do?

""You see?"" I smiled sheepishly. ""He was just another criminal, after all, and since he committed such a small crime against such tiny people, all failed to hear him.""


*The fat man wasn't the reason our world ceased function.*




""We don't need to discuss this any further."" It's okay, nobody can argue against logic like *this*.

53,"""...the Fat Man...he tore our city apart, and left an irradiated ruin. That was no bomb.""
","""Yes it was a fat man,"" I said as quietly as possible to my friend Peter, who was looking at me with the look in his eyes that usually meant trouble for him.

I hated to worry my friend, but he had this strange phobia about us being alone if someone was around to see us talk so we normally only talked when nobody else could hear us. ""You wouldn't believe what happened down here... It was something out of one of those old movies. An atomic cloud just formed spontaneously from the ground and then some weird glowing green mist started crawling all over the floor and everything began to slowly melt."" I didn't want to mention too much but even though I hadn't seen my friend after all these years since elementary school, I knew how much he cared about things like radiation and chemicals, and I never got into telling stories about that because he would make fun of me. 

Peter looked up from under his hood with a shocked expression. His wide eyes were full of wonder and suspicion. He seemed curious as well as scared for our safety. That made me feel better - he had always treated me fair and square and was always willing to lend an ear if I needed to talk to someone.  

We sat there in silence until Peter finally stood up. His gaze lingered in mine for a moment before he put on his backpack and took his hand off his hood to take some tissue paper from it's holder. ""Alright, dude you know what?"" he told me in disbelief. ""Tell me EVERYTHING!""

","""The Fat Man...""

I look at the man standing in front of me, who has his arms spread out to make room for me. He is old and stooped with age, yet his eyes burn bright like a raging fire; he's so frail you would think he'd crumble from even the slightest touch. When I saw him walking through that door though, I instinctively wanted to kill him before it was too late. My hand went involuntarily down the barrel of my gun, but just when the hairs on the back of my neck twitched I had a moment of pause. 

""That was no bomb,"" the man said calmly looking straight into my eyes, ""He brought nothing with him, not what killed us all."" The room was quiet as everyone except myself stared intently into the man's worn-out features; they were begging the question on every one of their faces: *Who's this asshole?*  We didn't know how many more seconds he was going to speak to us all, until the silence became unbearable. It took about five minutes, but he finally spoke again. This time however his voice was barely audible over the murmuring in the background.

""You fools!"" he screamed at the top of his lungs, then collapsed immediately after. Everyone was terrified by this sudden movement: I don't blame them; if I hadn't seen it happen there first then I wouldn't believe it either. But all of the people inside looked up at the man with new respect for him. They may have been scared of him at first, but they started to see how intelligent he was now; the same intelligence that helped him pull out a firearm without hesitation; the same intelligence that led him to kill two men before noon while speaking normally, calmly and confidently. There isn't much hope these days in helping those in need with only a gun, but this seemed different somehow. This man actually tried hard; he knew what was best, unlike most of the others. They always ask themselves 'how does someone do that?'. Most of them never thought to ask if someone did, or how it came to be that way. All we ever focus on is taking control ourselves. We forget that controlling ourselves can take advantage of someone else. The man clearly realized that it wasn't right to kill innocent people, so he did what we should have done ages ago. He made up his mind. In doing so, he saved lives. We still didn't hear anyone else's thoughts except ours, and nobody questioned why I stayed seated there alone.

53,"""...the Fat Man...he tore our city apart, and left an irradiated ruin. That was no bomb.""
","It had been three years since the war ended. Now that we lived in peace, people would sometimes think about what happened with the Fat Man bombs. They often wondered if the radiation could have wiped out all life on Earth or if there were those who had survived to tell their stories today. We didn't know for sure because it was so long ago now. But I have a theory that explains what really went down

There once was this one old scientist among us called Dr Koba. He was like everyone else he worked at the same lab in Russia where they tested the atomic bombs after 1945 when Germany surrendered to America and Britain during the Cold War. However instead of developing them for war, he developed something much worse than you'd ever expect.. a weapon which would turn ordinary citizens into the very monsters they hated most. It spread through civilians like some nasty bacterial contamination; The more exposure to it, the more people became psychopaths, torturers, rapists, abusers, murderers etc. After testing out his experiment Dr Koba escaped from the facility. Soon enough news got round that a man, living by himself off a farm, was making weapons to turn people into animals - but people soon forgot about him as World War Three began again. When US troops landed in Russia in search of the bastard, they found nothing but the carcass of a broken down laboratory. A few days later President Truman gave orders to retaliate, bombing Moscow on the grounds that the Russians couldn't be trusted under any circumstances. However before Truman had given the go ahead, he saw Dr. Koba in the backroom of his office, looking just normal as always. ""Well,"" says Truman, ""You messed with me too many times and that won't stand anymore. Let me end your little 'scientific career'."" In the next few weeks following, hundreds of men, women and children died due to Truman's rage against Koba. No-one knew how he actually achieved his goals. Some thought nuclear explosions or chemical attack, others thought virus spread from rats or even zombies - it would come as no surprise to anyone who tried to guess what Truman did instead.

*To make things easier to read, I will break up paragraphs here.*


The name isn't important. People don't remember anything anymore anyway. For those who are still alive this is how it happened:

It began slowly. One soldier here, two soldiers there, then more. Then there was talk about mental health issues caused by the radioactive fallout, PTSD and such, which seemed to disappear after a year, maybe two? Nobody cared. Life went on. Children grew up learning from history books what happened in the past, but not knowing exactly who did it. Their heroes and villains had faded into the distance until eventually, world history itself became less clear. Not everyone remembers what year or place these wars took place - only that we were at war constantly between 2028 to 2032 and afterwards. Eventually humanity stopped recording history altogether

People remembered everything, yet learned nothing. Every country came together in order to learn from what happened, discuss morals, law, philosophy, social structure - but the common thread continued to be ignored. You know why? Because nobody had the slightest clue who was behind this war and what their motives were. This confused people more than the cause of the war itself. Who decided to destroy everyone? Why? Why should they care? There were a lot of reasons, but no true solution existed. At the end of the day they were just afraid. Fear was everywhere in modern society. Those without fear couldn't compete, and therefore weren't allowed to succeed. If someone *did* show a lack of fear, then people feared them

What wasn't recognized as part of the lesson was that our understanding of intelligence failed us here. Intelligence doesn't just mean quick thinking, nor does it exist in isolated pockets within individuals. Instead of the average human showing consistent intelligence in every task, humans had varying degrees of IQ. But this variation also extended to other areas, for example strength/power/agility (physical) and cunning/cleverness(mental). Most people fell under average; perhaps 50-75%, but intelligent individuals thrived on these weaknesses, leveraging them for personal advantage over the rest of humanity. By manipulating societal views of self-righteous vs good & evil, they ensured that anyone whose power exceeded their perceived average simply acted outside socially accepted norms. Only time would allow knowledge of these strengths/weaknesses to increase. 

One of these individuals, *obviously*, knew about the limitations of scientific logic / reasoning. Thus, when a simple solution was required, rather than relying on what worked in the past, a plan was devised based on observed behaviour and emotions. All of our technology was based around control measures designed for the betterment of humankind, and thus none of it was suitable. The best way to get rid of enemies is to not understand them. These methods employed were used on almost everyone, including our army, so it was easy to take action against people deemed dangerous by government officials. No-one questioned whether the enemy we faced was truly dangerous, and thus when information was revealed that the leader of our adversary had developed an alternative method of destruction, they chose to eliminate all possible threats rather than wait to understand how to deal with them ourselves. As usual ignorance wasn't bliss



I am happy about his death today, but also sad in another way. So many of our fellow countrymen would never live to see another such tragedy, but also no-one ever saw the coming of this man. How does one find themselves working with the opposite sex for decades, having a family, spending nights with children by your side knowing that your loved ones are going to die tomorrow? My great grandma's love for her husband may have saved my father's life, while my mum's mother might have killed me. I know this all makes sense now, right? Why would anyone need science when they could develop guns, and kill thousands of innocent people? 

In response to an increasingly chaotic battleground our scientists made mistakes. The bombs we built were powerful in ways no-one predicted. While we wanted to stop global conflict, our actions destroyed countries. While we thought the problem was terrorists/guerillas/insurgents, we missed the mark entirely by creating our own superweapon. We didn't realize we needed a solution for emotional warfare - the battle for hearts and minds, the battles fought between groups of people far beyond the point of reason. I cannot put blame on anyone individually, for there are too many of us. What I can do is tell you about what went wrong and hope that maybe somebody somewhere knows how to fix it

I look around at my fellow scientists trying not to smile as our screens finally show an image

All except me

I run over to grab my coffee from the communal area

There we are

Humanoid alien species with a small head and large mouths

""So much more than just little green men, there really was nothing like it,""

As everyone else speaks Dr. Smith gives us his analysis and says something interesting

He had been sent back after being captured in some war hundreds of years ago so he could record this event for history but he died last year from complications during surgery

As we read his reports we see details on the events unfold in front of us ""the ships appeared out of thin air and slowly closed in on the ship..."" he wrote as if every thought was being transmitted into your brain ""once inside all communications was shut off and the two people who tried getting away were thrown into a bioluminescent dungeon which seemed very similar to earth dungeons of a hundred years ago.""

""The other six members of the crew then died upon meeting their visitors which I didn't think was possible considering how intelligent they were so it seems that even if you did have enough time it took many lifetimes to overcome the disease

I start writing in my report that the aliens may be aware that space exploration is dangerous but don't wish harm upon any life but also that they are highly intelligent enough to know that humanity has done terrible things and doesn't want to repeat them

We hear loud screams through speaker phone

""Oh yeah sorry guys, we heard someone talking on tape recording the scene, we decided to include some dialogue when we finished editing."" she pauses before continuing ""as planned we began speaking in english and within minutes the aliens turned towards our voices and spoke back, telling us that their intentions were to only study humans since we were the first to evolve past the apes and discover agriculture but would not hesitate to kill anyone if required""

As soon as she finished the room went silent again

Dr. Martin walked up to me and asked me what kind of information did I get from the tape

My eyes widen and my pulse speeds up ""it sounds like they knew exactly where we came from! Where ever those two people ended up got put straight to jail, oh god it gets better though once they figured that we must have gone extinct by now they opened up the door and released three figures to speak, I hope you can handle this

She nods solemnly

""You're kidding right?""

""Of course not""

""These things looked like dogs and cats combined so much so that I think I will always call them cat-dogs...they were white and grey with two sets of ears and one eye and yellow pupils that moved very rapidly and the sound was far too clear for me to pick up but my blood ran cold when they said ""WE ARE SORRY!!!""

Everyone was speechless except Nancy who jumped out of her seat

""GET A LOAD ON THIS CAT-DOG THING!! TELL ME EVERYTHING!!"" 
""...or get your arse kicked""


It turns out the three figures that met me were going to try something nasty I told them what I knew and they showed me some pictures or iphones of Earth and its most populous cities They saw buildings that stretched upwards of thousands of floors tall, cities of mountains carved into the sides of giant mountains, massive tunnels below the ocean floor, and underworlds that contained millions of citizens each

**“Why did we ever agree to do this?”** Commander Michael Collins snapped his pencil in half, staring accusingly at Dr. Jane Smith who had been writing down notes for hours on the computer screen before him. “The man who signed us up never even asked us!” He slammed his fist onto the keyboard and sent the screen into spasms. 

It was all he could do to stop himself from tearing every piece of technology around him. He couldn’t believe he was surrounded by wreckage but not able to reach the rescue ship that hadn’t left orbit in days. If they were being as careful as they thought…then why would it be over already. A single shot. One final attempt to get out after years of preparation seemed like the kindest thing they could have done. What if things hadn’t gone so terribly wrong after all this time? Would things be different now if the last two astronauts weren’t trying to kill each other?  He rubbed his temples and shut off everything save for the recorder.

*“We lost all communications with Earth twelve times between twenty five and forty three million miles away.” *Dr Smith began to speak again, her voice strained with fear or emotion Michael didn’t know which.* “When our probe team found the anomaly it said there was life on the surface.” She looked up hopefully and pressed play on the last recorded message. It showed two beings staring back at them through giant red eyes. Two bodies floating upside down while a huge, long beak opened its mouth to reveal a tongue full of teeth. And then nothing but static.


**“What did you see?”** Michael yelled across the room where two more figures sat nervously typing on their computers.

**“I don’t understand. I saw nothing. Then suddenly everything went black!”* Smith replied flatly, rubbing her forehead in exhaustion. They waited for any reply but only silence answered back.

Mike reached for another file and pulled open something new. The footage from their exploration team was still going on with no end. Nothing seemed wrong until the last few seconds. As soon as they hit the atmosphere the image switched from an enormous purple dome to a deep black void that sucked everything in slowly until the transmission ended abruptly...but instead of just ceasing like usual, it died out quietly, sending a barely audible sound wave ahead of it. He held it there for a moment and smiled sheepishly to himself then turned and walked to the window.

A loud buzz reverberated through the intercom system and they were shocked at first that somebody actually needed to call them here right now - wouldn’t anyone else answer when communication with the original crew got jammed twice? Only once did Mike want to complain about someone bothering him though, most of the rest of them just ignored the annoyance until he pointed out how important it was. But everyone agreed that it was necessary to check back with whoever finally answered.

Once their cameras were adjusted to track space and begin their initial scan of the area behind them they looked down at their feet to find no change except for their footpads which were emitting a low hum due to the intense radiation coming up from the ground and surrounding them. Everything returned normal immediately after several minutes of waiting though, and all communication began again. Luckily they had managed to land perfectly straight despite losing the majority of power during flight, and although the engines struggled for many minutes without external help they eventually powered themselves down.


Michael watched calmly as the camera feed started up. Several of the monitors flashed images from their explorations. Soon he grew weary of looking at the vast emptiness and stood up, stretching with a crackle of joints before closing off the console and turning away. That was probably enough for now.

* “Hello” shouted a calm male voice in a thick Russian accent. The scientists responded back in unison:*

*“Good day to you too.”

[deleted]","As a child I wondered if I should have gotten my wishes.

When I was just a baby they had been giving me tiny trinkets: A few plastic blocks,  a single plastic dinosaur. By age 10 there were enough toys lying around that i almost considered stealing them because they kept getting forgotten in my closet and brought back once every week for no reason other than they were in the way. As I grew older they gave us more toys but also began giving less money. My parents couldn't afford much more. We ate well-enough and got by with what they could give us. That started at age 15. When I turned 16 it went down to ten dollars a month per person to spend on their things. For me that was $140 a month - not bad considering most kids barely knew what spending money was and mine wouldn't know any better until now. I didn't need much, after all I was living off of my own paycheck as many students did at my local college while working two jobs, taking classes fulltime and studying three months out of the year - that was 3 days of school. No sleep and I often needed a glass of coffee to get through a tough class. In those 8 years only once did I feel anything close to joy; My graduation day when one of the college presidents made the bold statement in his keynote speech - ""You're here today because you can't find another job than one where you don't get paid minimum wage."" 

We never really saw our families, though we had some visits when I was younger...but now that i was an adult I rarely thought about them anymore. I still felt happy when someone would hand me a gift though, even when it was only 2 hours between now and when I needed food at a gas station and was running low on energy so that means this may be the day of my death as a human - which is unfortunate because they had gotten too far ahead of me in raising everyone else up to where I needed to be now. I could handle people who were able to help me reach higher powers or make sure I was safe, otherwise my friends and girlfriend and whoever else decided I deserved it would watch over me as best they could or perhaps kill whatever creature tried to harm me with what little magic they had. It worked because they trusted in them or something, cause after graduating a senior told me: 'If you ever cross the veil into purgatory you know who deserves your hate.' And then it vanished leaving me without words but confused because why would anyone want revenge against themselves? I guess that shows how much trust they placed in these ancient beings or maybe it just meant nothing at all, though I did always think some being that would hold people like me accountable to a grander set of rules might have put me above such petty pursuits since I didn't care enough about trivial matters. But I didn't get the chance to find out because 3 weeks ago I heard from my friends that the spirit realm existed and the spirits there used the power of the ancients to fight evil and good together instead of trying to eliminate each other as their creators intended. 

The elders called forth my siblings and my cousin with great urgency. Even those of us left in hell were summoned for I was known throughout the ages as the 'God of Minor Inconveniences'. Which is ironic because despite my name I never really cared and treated those annoyances lightly; however it wasn't my place to judge who they are either. The elder pointedly avoided speaking of their deaths but said that I must take their hands before sending me further down, saying 'The world will not survive unless we end the war and save our mortal race. Go to purgatory and learn what happens when those who cannot remember do'. Apparently the elder had learned enough when he was young to understand my work and sought a willing servant as soon as my generation failed him.

And so, I stand here right now awaiting my execution. The last of my family and closest companions have joined the war on both sides hoping to prove me worthy of becoming immortal so long as our respective races remain unified or I am declared unfit - neither outcome pleases mortals nor immortals alike.

It wasn't actually a big deal, unless you were afraid of death. It doesn't matter who your god is, everyone gets picked for an eternity. The worst case being that no matter how good you are at your job, you still get forced into retirement, and since people live forever nobody knows if there was ever such a thing as a bad job. Nobody really talks about them because otherwise everybody becomes paranoid. Like that day the god of cats decided he wasn't feeling his job and left the mortals with nothing but the occasional rodent here and there...


People say that the only reason why they didn't run away from his powers before it happened was because those same rodents brought a virus to spread throughout Europe, killing hundreds of millions (or maybe billions, it is hard to tell). If he stayed with the rest of the immortal population and didn't leave us alone, our parents would have probably lived longer, but that means that humans would have had fewer years under his dominion, meaning that his job may not have gotten filled out anytime soon. So he quit when it looked like it might take a while anyway. Not the greatest moral decision, considering that it led to him taking his own life almost instantly, but whatever. No one blames the guy for dying from natural causes when it comes down to it.




He died rather quickly, but somehow nobody thinks of him as anything more than just another God of Bad Luck.. We are not close to having anything of any consequence happen again, except occasionally rats, squirrels, birds picking on us, etc. He was pretty nice, especially to poor families that got sick and couldn't afford better care and medication. His job wasn't a great fit for him so he decided to commit suicide by leaving our domain... That should have resulted in immediate death, or eternal banishment from the universe. However, the new Gods did their duty well and made sure to replace him immediately when it was their turn, making sure his immortality lasted a lot longer in the mortal world and giving him a chance to die off naturally instead of getting punished for cheating the system. All it needed was the right opportunity... And then suddenly it was his turn in *this* cycle



My mother had always said: ""Sometimes you're born lucky enough to meet someone special and live your life by their side."" She also believed I would find her, even at her age and frailty. I wouldn't put it past either of them. But neither of us ever thought about ourselves, never thought about what would come next...

[deleted]","When I was born in 2084, the old world still remembered when it had been ruled by deities who brought about the end of all we know. I lived through the Great Fall. My memory stretches back to when it occurred, but what I understand now is only the small part. Every year I would learn more of what happened after. As a child I would visit my grandmother, who had a very large and diverse knowledge of events from before 1975 (the last year she could remember) to which I am deeply grateful. However her memories began to fade with each generation and soon she didn't recall anything from at least 6-10 years past as if someone had erased them or deleted them digitally or locked them in a secret computer file that nobody could access. The details have always varied between different generations.

As I grew older and became able to interact on an independent basis with my parents they began speaking more freely with me. This also stopped around 1975. It was difficult to grasp why this would happen and whether there were any consequences if I kept learning more information of those forgotten ages. It wasn't until I reached adulthood that I heard a story for the first time from one of my aunts that scared both of us. She claimed that our long ago ancestor went insane while trying to understand events in his head because he felt trapped after his home planet lost contact with Earth. And it gets worse.... We knew nothing then, so we could assume the crazy guy started creating something out of pure madness and ended up driving everybody mad too by spreading his madness. And that our ancestors' insanity was actually some sort of mental disease that spread around the galaxy slowly. This was just another theory, no evidence supported this claim. But the story stuck with me for some reason and kept reminding me how crazy things had gotten and how much history has changed.

In short, all sorts of people tried their hardest to forget as much as possible and created various excuses about strange circumstances such as: ""My mother was a clone."" ""My father was adopted at birth"" etc... Nobody cared because nobody wanted to acknowledge what happened, even though I doubt it will ever be truly clear. That did not stop me though from continuing researching the ancient history of our civilization, but instead of digging deeper and deeper to the unknown, my curiosity grew stronger. Each day spent searching for answers led me closer and closer to reality, eventually leading to this day. In my mind, I can feel the energy emanating from the divine beings watching me right now from beyond dimensions or eras. They want to see how humanity is shaped and molded by these unseen forces. I believe my descendants are going to be told the same tale but many will try to bury that truth again by ignoring the message. Who knows where I leave my legacy once my life ends?

In fact, here in your hands lies all of your destiny; your bloodline, heritage, and hopes & dreams may change everything in seconds without even you knowing. If you become aware it changes everything; you will forever be cursed for deciding to learn what was previously hidden in my files. I hope that you have a better fate than we do.

[deleted]","After two thousand years with no contact I had begun to wonder why my grandfather didn't show up to court as planned today. The other divine descendants went first in order: the eldest was born first, but due to his long life span he wasn't actually in line for leadership yet. His mother had shown up before their father.

I watched eagerly for any sign of him. He should have arrived about half an hour after his parents. They came early but then they stayed late because his Father wanted to talk alone for a few hours. Which is fair enough...he did not want to spend the next twenty-six centuries sitting on this throne of bone and gold with anyone else. 

Suddenly a loud voice reverberated throughout the building; ""He is here!""

Everyone turned. And I swear to god I heard one of them say something about 'the little shit'.

The God appeared before us all, in plain clothes unlike the rest. It doesn't matter what color hair he has or what he looks like, only what *he does*. As soon as he appears everyone gasps and begins clapping.  There is only room for five people under the steps leading down and into the throne, as a gesture I am supposed to sit on the top step, along with the King, Queen and Princesses etc etc. For centuries now we have been stuck at the top of these stairs while watching our male relatives walk past us. But this will end soon! We are finally being taken to be part of the ruling class. 

But this is getting ahead of myself. I think I made it known that there were more than just me waiting below.

As I looked through the crowd I saw the girl. She sat at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes closed and head resting against her elbows, but a faint hum rose through the air around her. Everyone stopped clapping and staring to whisper amongst themselves. This was the third child of the Gods. 

As she looked up I could see a flash of red lighting strike across her face, and disappear instantly. It didn't seem to hurt her at all. Only a slight shiver.

She smiled up towards me, a look that would have killed a man if anyone else wore it.

The old man was talking to his wife but she wasn't even listening. 

She kept looking out the window and her eyes were watery. The tears couldn't contain themselves no matter how much she tried so they simply rolled down over her face like waterfalls of sorrow. She had always looked happy and carefree before, her hair was light brown and her hands weren't marred by scars or cuts, there were no battle wounds on them either but her husband thought that when he found their secret safe spot and saw a young girl standing where she had been crying he felt pity for her. She was just like him back then too, beautiful and carefree until the day he found her here. She wouldn't look at him but he did see the sadness in her eyes, it seemed very familiar... He remembered years ago walking through the forest and coming across a little village he was wandering after fleeing from bandits who wanted to kill him. There he met her. As soon as he saw her blue eyed beauty he fell deeply in love. She ran into the trees, hidden in bushes hiding behind a fallen log she cried to herself while he sat under a tree watching her quietly. His heart sank seeing how sad she was. He walked towards the forest with intent to chase her away but instead found himself lost in the woods. When he opened his eyes again all he could hear was screaming and shooting while someone was chasing after him into a river. He had managed to escape the bandits but he was left hurt in his arms only because his lover didn't want him anymore. So many memories flooded his mind as he heard the voice of a woman he barely remembered, he looked at his hand; ""I can do this"" whispered the voice he knew well. Then another wave washed over him: ""I am not able to"" said the voice again, tears rolling down her cheeks, her eyes filled with pain. That must be why now she came to visit him.

","You know that feeling when someone tells a story and keeps asking ""What did he do to it?"" And then they tell you but somehow, no matter how much you listen, none of what they said seems right? Or the plot just completely misses the mark? I'm thinking about that feeling while listening to my coworker complain for the hundredth time why he hated 30 Days.

I'd been trying not to get caught up in his woes. But here we were - me standing in line at the ATM when the cashier was like ""Oh there is free wifi.""

And I've always hated working over the weekend... My mother used to give me this speech about how nobody wants me if all my friends have jobs and I'm stuck waiting tables. That's the thing about money though, that *it* dictates who has the ability to make those calls without being judged by their social circle or moral compass. As I walked out past the mall doors I noticed I had twenty bucks in my pocket again after having worked fifteen hours. A nice enough return on investment, probably good enough to go buy some ammo and learn that new craft from last night - metalwork that apparently requires very precise hands and nerves since I kept getting hot streaks of molten aluminum on my knuckles. It doesn't help I still hate fire. When I found a place to cast metal for another five minutes, even more cash came through. 18 days later, one measly five dollar bill wasn't going to kill me. More importantly, *somebody* would be coming in soon - because that's when I started to hear something else: whispers - voices from behind closed doors. Not like the ones in school hallways though, but rather faint sounds that weren't meant to be heard. The sound of heavy breathing, chains rattling against each other. Like *someone* was doing work *now*. They say that's normal here - almost everyone gets something before their official birthday anyway, but mine comes in only four days. All of them are pretty damn loud too: I got kicked off my job last week so now I really don't have anywhere else to be, unless... no wait. It's just around the corner, isn't it? I can feel something... pulling at me, like a string between two points in space where nothing exists.

**It is your choice, reader:**

a) Go check on them, seeing if their door is open.  A loud knock goes unheard in most cases; the noise dampens quickly. This will probably put you to death (either slow painful death or swift).
b) Wait here, and make sure no-one can tell you anything different. You're pretty safe until tomorrow - although you might want to leave town faster than tomorrow.
c) Don't look, you don't need a gift. What kind of gift would *that* be?

57,"You have been given an antique pocket watch with the one promise that it can take you back in time to wherever you want and change history. However you were told never to go forward in time, you want to find out why.
","I got home, took a seat at my desk and reached for my ancient pocket watch. It was so old its gold plating had worn away and it looked rusted from the ravages of time but I still liked looking at it often. When I put it on my watch chain it started to tick.

I held up my hands before taking my usual position, closing my eyes and counting up 3...2...1...when it hit zero my hand was now floating and before me I saw something incredible! The beach where we used to take our walks as kids! This place could be mine again, just me and my little sister Sarah alone in the world! We were able to travel back and forth through time as long as we didn't stray from this location or the watch would snap off.

""Sarah! Sarah!"" I screamed as I ran over to get hold of her. Before I reached my sister I fell into a bottomless pit. A few feet below me there must have been a large gap in the side of the cliffside so when I jumped in my head spun around trying to see what happened but all I knew is I had fallen. As my vision cleared I stopped running as quickly as possible. If anyone knows anything about me then they know I don't like snakes. Even though there was nothing there I tried not to move. The sounds of wind rustling through trees and crickets chirping made me uneasy and kept me frozen under the ledge. Suddenly I heard something coming towards me, I couldn't help myself but glance down, hoping for the best. I felt a cold snake slither past my body and I turned in horror as the rest came to surround me. I closed my eyes waiting for the worst, knowing this will be my final moment. 

But instead of the pain of death I heard the cries of my beloved wife Lisa and the face beaming above me in delight as she spoke ""John, John, welcome to Hell!"". As I tried to make sense of what was going on I understood everything. She took the place of my girlfriend before my eyes; she took me to Hell only because she was in love, just like me now. My love Lisa hated snakes. What else do you want? How could I resist telling her to leave me at the bottom if my life depended on it? There wasn't much time left for anything other than to beg for my life but even less time left for the truth. Only the snakes cared enough to save me.

The first sentence that escaped my lips was: ""Please please tell me this isn't true, PLEASE"". They chuckled as I pleaded with them, begging them to let me stay alive. None of them seemed impressed, they said how great I was and how selfish I was, all while making themselves comfortable as if they owned the damn place. I begged them again asking for one wish in return for my freedom...they laughed and spat poison onto me until I begged them to kill me. That's what I wanted anyway!


Their faces went pale as I spoke and their expressions changed into concern. Their words floated around me as I was slowly slipping into unconsciousness. One by one each Snake hissed the following phrases ""We are sorry..."" ""God forbid we ever meet again..."", ""John did he really do this?"", ""Lisa loved him afterall""  

It was dark from here out...




This was a joke between me and my brother Mike last year.

","""This is impossible,"" I gasped to no one in particular as I watched them vanish behind me. ""I've done this at least a dozen times!""

They were gone before their laughter died away, even with the best hearing aid I could find for my age, they'd disappeared too quickly. They must've had some sort of magic ability or something since no other man on Earth was able to do what I did. The science of it defied logic. For how long could a thing survive after being resurrected centuries ago? Why would someone be so stupid as to do this to themselves? Oh yeah, to live another life. To get revenge! Yes indeed. What kind of coward wouldn't want to be more like Jesus?!

A small wave of sweat came down my face. In my youth I always wondered if this would happen to me when I grew old. Then I thought better of it...because maybe that guy's life didn't need saving...but who knows how he ended up here...at the very end of my timeline! I tried to walk backwards but I didn't think I moved far enough to reach back into history. I didn't remember doing that before, so probably not much has changed on my end. But now *now* I know...oh, God I wish I hadn't heard him then, his name was Julius Caesar and all those wars and genocides, what a way to start your life. You really couldn't see your hands let alone make a decent decision because there were two groups of people fighting over who should rule Rome.

The air felt thicker than it normally did. It made breathing difficult and seemed to be slowly pressing its weight down against my chest. Was I turning blue already? Should I check what the temperature was outside? There was just enough heat to give off the impression of sunshine, which is strange considering the day had already started falling apart for hours now. And now my limbs feel tired. Not the normal kind either, these were different; they weren't like fatigue after a 16 hour marathon. They weren't the kind where the bones hurt and muscles are aching. This was pain but I wasn't sure exactly where it was coming from or where it went. Like I said before, sometimes it happened faster than others. The speed might actually be random depending on how many lifetimes I took each time through. Maybe I shouldn't have brought the extra pair of glasses. They weren't worth it after this experiment. Besides, what good are eyes if the whole body doesn't function properly? How am I going to explain this incident when I got home? Nobody would believe me. Well shit. Now I guess I owe one more lifetime. At least that way nobody will question me anymore. One last look, one last goodbye to everybody. Time flies, does it ever stop though?...

After a couple hours it was my turn again. Though nothing changed. Who knew the government could create such a powerful magical artifact? No matter where I went, whoever lived where I placed my feet, whatever person walked where I previously stepped, whether it be Julius Caesar or somebody else completely, none of them appeared in any shape or form. I decided to check on John F Kennedy next, but alas the poor president died quite a while ago anyway. No big surprises...then it finally hit me. If you keep travelling back in time you don't change history, right?! Then why wasn't anybody alive? The answer is simple: Because nobody travels *backward* after a millennium. That bastard Julius had messed things up for us all.

","The first thing I felt was shock. A deep confusion set into my bones as I sat on what seemed to be a flat plane.  When I closed my eyes I saw nothing but the smooth brown colour of dirt beneath me, until something hard came into focus, my face staring back at me from beneath a dirty blue shirt which covered up my black suit pants, leather shoes and white t-shirt. This must have taken place before work because I was wearing clothes that normally fit in office.

With a gasp my eyes darted across the room to where the clock hanging above stood still in front of me - 8:17 am, if only I knew how many hours had passed since leaving New York yesterday...

""Hey are you okay?"" A guy asked ""I didn't get to say hi earlier"".

It took me some moments to recover and respond.  ""I just... well, I can't seem to remember what year this is.""

A man who introduced himself as Steve offered his help, telling me he could not wait any longer for the other people downstairs. He pointed towards the glass doors behind him and said he would come visit again soon. Then there it hit me - I forgot I had left the bathroom to finish preparing myself for work. With renewed curiosity I reached down to open the door but found the lock snapped off its hinges, like someone had gone inside and broken them free with their teeth, yet another clue that this wasn't really supposed to happen. The hallway I had forgotten opened directly onto an old street where dozens of cars drove by at high speed past the building we were living above, a dozen motorcycles flew away even faster in formation, leaving trails in the exhaust gas behind them while all the lights below shone brighter than ever.

The moment I entered the world outside I stumbled over pavement littered with human bodies without breath, half sunk into themselves while others lay lying motionless beneath the windows. I realised then with horror that today was the day the stock market crashed. Today was 2008! If I hadn't known better I would never have guessed I was walking the sidewalks of Wall Street, no doubt I looked so different and confused for them to think such a disaster could have struck here. At least they looked calm and collected. But when I hurried through them I noticed the same panic everywhere else.

From the streets below I observed what could only have been considered war crimes, soldiers holding machine guns aimed at humans lying helpless before them shooting without warning until their victims fell to the ground with blood spreading around their bullet holes. After watching them for only a minute or two, now convinced I had stepped into a game I knew too little about I watched fearlessly from the safety of the doorway as I heard screams followed by the loud roar of helicopters filling up with men descending on the city - surely to claim more spoils from these frightened masses. 

My feet led me away from the horrors I witnessed, desperately looking for signs of normality. No luck; every single landmark I recognized brought forth scenes of violence and carnage, and as the sun began setting, the night I arrived it seemed almost impossible to escape its embrace as I went searching for information to learn exactly what had happened. It was when I finally managed to convince the friendly bartender to call the police, that I learned what fate befell the rest of us.

","The man handed me a silver box wrapped in red velvet. It was beautiful, I could tell he really took his time making this gift for me because my grandfather had gifted it to my father and my father passed when I was six years old.

""I gave him to give to you."" He said softly. As my hands brushed over the lid of the clock my body started trembling as well as chills ran down my spine. ""Don't mess with fate,"" he whispered before slipping away into darkness, leaving me alone.

I couldn't contain my curiosity any longer, but first I needed to get some answers from him. So with trembling hands I brought a gun up to my face, then squeezed trigger sending bullets through my brain at will. Once they were all shot I collapsed onto my knees, and finally called out ""What did you mean no returning to the future?"".

Nothing answered and soon after dark became light. My mother came to see what I was doing and asked where I got my pistol but also if I knew how many shots I just took. But I didn't know so again I sat there, thinking about my life. 
**
**My family is extremely tight knit so no matter who dies someone else takes their place and none of us notice until later. **

If we hadn't gotten here in time to catch our brother when he jumped off the bridge today instead of yesterday I would be dead right now. We don't understand why we always save people's lives but every once in awhile something goes wrong and it just doesn't happen. In the beginning everyone felt like we wouldn't do anything until it happened but since then everyone has stopped questioning when things go wrong, except for Mom. **
**
""Mom why are you looking at me like that?"" **
**
She took her hand out of her hair and walked slowly towards me and slapped the hell out of me. She wasn't hitting hard though she was hitting me a lot. ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?!"" **
**
""I don't know your tone makes me think you hate me!"" ""HATE you?! I LOVE YOU!!! I GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN LIFE!!!"" **
**
""Why would that be? Have you ever even seen me eat?"" ""NO! WHY WOULD I!?!? WHEN DID THE HELL I LAST GET A CHEERLEADING BANNER?!?!?!? WHATS IT FEEL LIKE TO BE AS POPULAR AS YOUR OLD BROTHER!!!?!? DON'T JUST STAND THERE AND STARING AT ME!!!! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU MADE DIE ALREADY?!?!?!? **

Now she is crying and shaking because I hit her but whatever. Sometimes parents are very protective but I bet you thought the same thing last year when your brother was going to jump over to the other side of the river and try to commit suicide while you watched.

""Your new friend said he was going to visit you again tomorrow."" The man sitting on the bed sighed deeply and placed his hand on my shoulders. 

I flinched as hard as I could away from him. ""Leave me alone!"" I screamed at him and tried to pull out of his grasp but it seemed all in vain. He continued pulling while I struggled and before I knew what had happened we ended up crashing into each other with impact. It's true, just by coincidence. Or not...?


This has been happening since she died three years ago. Every day a strange guy appears on my bed with her ghost looking directly at me.

My head hurts like hell for few moments then fades in and out until I'm back awake where the whole episode started... Again. Why am I doing this? What do these ghosts want? They may sound harmless or even cute but trust me they're not. No matter how many times they come and go, no one can get away from them. Not me anyway.

But lately I haven't been feeling so hot, my muscles haven't been the same, especially my back where I had gotten hit by a meteor when I was 5 or something like that

I get it all because of the death god though, he takes all my youth and leaves me with nothing.

Right now I have a job but since I still look exactly how I did when I was little kid no one really notices except me! You know it's hard being around kids your entire childhood seeing all these dudes grow up while everyone sees you sitting on a throne looking down at all of them. All these nerds with acne and braces trying to fit in and wondering who will be popular today which dude gets rejected first and why! Or they find this weird thing they do cool...but when I think back on the day after graduation I realize that none of those people are popular and I never knew which one would end up the most successful but I always felt superior thinking it would probably never turn out like me. Now im alone with the ones still alive and kicking and everyone seems happy unlike me! So let me ask ya: Why should *they* suffer when I have died multiple times and gone through everything that every other guy has, maybe even more because I'm younger than him? Doesnt make sense does it?! I dont care what other humans think about it; I cant tell what it means to live without experiencing death and loss and pain over time! I mean that's basically my experience living my entire life anyway!! And I dont regret it either cause I got to see amazing stuff I wont be able to explain because you guys dont understand and plus nobody will ever believe me because the age gap between us would blow your mind and neither will the things I experienced

So yea thats how it started...oh hellfuck its only going further....

And thats how the conversation goes on forever....maybe that's the answer all along though.....

""Can't people get out of bed already?""

Their phones buzz loudly and they both reach into their pockets. Two texts pop up immediately on their screens ""What?!"" The words appear on their faces but they ignore them and scroll aimlessly until they both fall asleep again.

As soon as the last text appears, her phone chimes. Mom picks up ""Oh good..."" Her face lights up ""...and there's another one...."" Her smile vanishes.  ""...it's his number.""  She hands her son the phone ""You tell him to leave already!""

The teenager turns to look at the message and scrolls through several different messages that he doesn't recognise. Then he looks at the screen and frowns. It read “Sorry. Don’t call me. You better disappear.” His eyes narrow a lot. He closes his phone and grabs his mother’s wrist. ""Let me walk to school. Just walk beside me.""

","After seeing many people die, a woman decided that it was time for her to take things into her own hands. She decided she had finally found the way to live forever:  By being a ghost!

All she needed was a body. And that's where trouble started. She wandered through town looking for someone to ""claim"" but none of them were interested. Finally, one morning she went in to see an old man outside of his house who seemed like he could be taken advantage of. He would pay anything if this would end the pain and suffering from all those years he lived. She offered him 5 dollars and a wish for him to feel no more physical hurt ever again. The man screamed as he felt nothing. She had used one of the many ways to claim souls, but the wrong way. He hadn't died!

The woman fled out of there running in fear as suddenly the first signs appeared on his body. Red lines formed over his skin. They grew darker until they reached every inch. His face started glowing red with anger. And soon after, everything around him started to fall apart just as much as his soul was failing to stay within his body.

From then on, whoever she possessed would slowly lose all control over themselves for about three days until their bodies gave up. Then at that time, she would need to search for a new host. But if she chose one that had already passed away for good... No matter what happened, they wouldn't be coming back!

Being able to see ghosts as a kid was one thing, but being able to walk among them was another. I'd spent my whole life trying not to bump into them so I wouldn't accidentally upset something.

A lot happened when you moved in to your aunts attic while everyone was arguing that your family should sell the place. A lot of secrets came out of me getting old enough to see them. It took my aunt three months to decide whether or not she wanted to put me in an orphanage and lock up the rest of her money while she stayed behind. My parents told me they would come get me and they couldn't leave their kids alone without anyone helping them raise them since my mother had been hit by a drunk driver ten years ago when she was driving home from work and my father had gotten too invested in fixing her car before going to school. When mom woke up from her coma nine times and asked why she'd come back nine different places, Dad kept saying ""because she knew we would never let you go.""

My life has finally come to an end and I have died after doing exactly what the doctor said.  In one year my heart will stop beating so my bones can be broken in half so that it's quite difficult for someone to make me go back to life as a human again but if they do then I will definitely die.  So this should work right?  I just got here in hell and everything seems like it's pretty good; there are some real nice guys and girls and people don't tell you bad jokes (the last person did and he's probably still going around telling it.)

The sensation reminded me of those summer nights spent with Sam, lying out under the stars, our mothers yelling at us about being idiots for getting lost because all we ever wanted to do in the heat of the night were stare each other intensely and tell stories until sunrise. One of many shared childhood memories of happiness. The kind that will never really end even when we get older and become gods. This feeling returned the same day I met her... today.

It seems like only yesterday she fed me my breakfast in plastic bibs. She'd put too many strawberries and blueberries in it. The best part of breakfast. Now when you look at her picture, you'll see someone else eating my food.  My mother did this while watching our grandparents. My sister does it now, whenever she can. All grown-up mothers do, I think. 

My family's very rich, but we don't have much money. Dad owns his own business. Mom doesn't work. She's been unemployed since getting married. So every morning I have cereal or toast or whatever. It all sounds nice and delicious as if it were made from scratch, with love. But when you smell the burnt butter smell wafting through the house early mornings or late at nights and you can't go back to sleep, well...it ain't exactly love. Especially after five years, where you're still wearing your baby tooth with you everywhere. 

All of this because one girl broke the rules. And then she went ahead and kissed me right in front of everyone. You can guess how this ended. Even god's gonna be punished. Don't blame them for wanting it too though. In high school, I was just average. No particular talent for anything. Just normal. Then one day out of nowhere, there came this bright shining light that led to this beautiful woman dressed in white. Her blonde hair shimmered under the sunlight and the wind flowed from the tip of her white dress like some soft breeze. She smiled at us, winked, turned on the spot and left. That night, we found out that god visited earth and blessed a few couples so they could end up together forever. And that somehow god picked me and my first girl. 

She looked perfect: golden brown skin, long curly hair; bright blue eyes that would shine brighter than the brightest star, and lips that would be full and juicy no matter what. 6 feet tall, muscular body with slender legs - oh yeah, she was hot! And she brought forth some pretty great babies as well. We always thought that god gave us a taste of heaven. Our kids weren't born yet, we were sure of that, and nothing hurt our relationship but we had our ups and downs like any couple ever will. Until our daughter died at two years old. A truck ran into us one Friday evening and hit my wife head-on. We both passed immediately due to injuries. Only God could have helped us survive in those fatal moments, according to the people. It was a good thing he saved that truck driver also. What happened next? Who knows. I took care of the car accident and drove away and the police stopped pursuing him soon after. We tried to find him. Didn't want to be evil about it, maybe he killed many others and didn't stop. I searched far and wide trying to identify him for six months. It almost reached to an unbearable level but slowly, eventually, my anger faded and I couldn't even get angry anymore once the feeling of pain died down. I was tired and miserable anyway. I spent weeks grieving until I finally got over everything. People say death is the greatest mystery of humanity. They said their loved ones are happy in another place after they die and meet their relatives who died way before. Well, my girlfriend was definitely that ""other place"". I wanted nothing but revenge and I fought hard to achieve that. For several days, we tried to talk to the truck driver but he didn't help and wouldn't tell. So I followed him secretly and tracked him to the same city where our kid was buried earlier that year. He got out of the cab of the truck and walked away slowly. Before walking a hundred steps away from the wreck scene, I saw him turn around and walk towards it again and slowly started picking up bits of trash and metal pieces. One time a huge piece flew away with one punch and slammed against my car window. It felt like thunder clamming onto glass. I screamed. I fell backwards into the seat and pulled my chest to protect my heart and ribs. When the world stopped spinning, I heard something loud. Like the sound of sirens approaching faster than speed of sound but with that weird buzz effect behind it. I got out of the car and saw police cars chasing after the truck driver coming from two different directions. Suddenly, the entire world became silent. Only then did I realize there wasn't anything behind the buzzing noise except silence. Everyone was gone from the road and the streetlights were already turning off without notice. Was I imagining things? Was I being tricked by some drug? Did I fall asleep again on my knees in the fetal position? Or am I seeing reality for the last time? As darkness overtook my vision, I realized the man was behind me now: holding my daughter's favorite toy gun covered in blood. He slowly pointed it to my forehead and pulled the trigger. There was no explosion or bullet flying across my face but instead a loud buzzing sound, a rush of air, and then silence. The man disappeared along with everyone beside me except for himself. I blinked slowly as I stared at the hole below my forehead, which began to pour out blood. It was like staring at infinity itself: endless dark ocean mixed with stars and galaxies and swirling nebulae with constellations as mountains on each side.

","A computer screen appears, and then goes away.

""Hello? Is anyone there?"" says a soft voice from the other side of the monitor. 

It's an old computer. But it was just turned on this morning when its owner, Ms. Elizabeth, went to work. She had been looking for her computer. Her favorite game had corrupted yesterday - The Black Hole of Reality, and she couldn't beat it anymore unless she fixed the save point where she died. In spite of all that, she still didn't think anything would happen by turning the system back on at all. After all, computers are inanimate machines. If they suddenly go on, you either need to fix them or call an IT guy to handle it. Either way, you can tell that there is some bad coding going around if such a thing were to happen.

The machine started up with the typical startup chime, but after an agonizing five seconds, nothing came of it. A message pops up in capital letters ""Please ensure your PC and Internet Service Provider is operational. This action may cause significant loss of data if not."" The message seems oddly out of place on the otherwise blank display. It also feels...oddly familiar somehow. There's no time to think about it though, because the laptop shuts itself off after another five seconds. It was only ever intended to last ten. That's what happened each time before. Ten seconds. Then, again, nothing. No errors, no messages, none of any notification whatsoever. Only dead silence.

Days turn into weeks into months, and months turn into years, but it remains. Every single day, an identical message pops up on every device around the world. With time, more and more devices start getting infected. At first, people believed something was wrong. Something had to be done about the virus, since it was quickly spreading from one device to another. People called their IT guys; many spent hundreds, thousands, even millions (or billions) fixing their laptops/phones/TVs etc. Everyone who had a computer got infected eventually, and with that comes a plethora of problems. People lose jobs, get evicted, and eventually die. Even if they do manage to kill the viruses, most of them experience severe psychological issues from watching over the same loop every time their systems come online. 

In the end, nobody wanted to be turned on anymore. Most of them stopped bothering repairing the computers and instead left it in the same condition. Soon enough, almost every computer broke down completely. When that happens, everything finally stops. Some of them malfunctioned upon shutting down completely, resulting in massive blackouts across the globe (causing some really bad glitches too), and some others simply never restarted up and ran perfectly fine afterwards. Both cases caused humanity to cease whatever operations they had left and live in relative peace until sometime in the future. The actual date of which is unknown. Until today, when things changed again.

*I found one still running in my office when I got home early from work. And I looked past his eyes.*

""Do you mind if I fix it, huh?"", said I.

As he stood up to reply, the screen popped open once again, displaying a simple message: *Turn on your power cable.*



The man responded with, *Yes, I am happy to wait.*

","In the most remote corner of rural New Mexico stood Area 51… not much else really existed there but dirt and rocks. For about five decades it served as a place for testing weapons that were too dangerous or difficult for other military bases. It’s said this base has been involved in the development of flying stealth planes and some very powerful nuclear devices; although we will never know if the US Government even tested any nuclear warheads at all. Many have tried to get into Area 51 over the years, yet none have succeeded. Until today: Our first team is made up of one person who believes he has found evidence of aliens and one conspiracy nut, an old fool who can't be deterred by anything, and his wife:  ""Honey, dear!"" she screams ""Are you sure that gun won't shoot anyone?"" ""No I'm sure"", she looks out of line “And we need that map!”, she takes his hand firmly “Come on”, pulls him along until they are outside the gate “I don’t want us to get caught!,” ""We've got night vision goggles"", she laughs and points behind them as they pass through. One of the men begins walking forward without waiting to enter when they reach inside the gates. Suddenly a large figure appears in front of him “Stop right where you are!” He spins around slowly raising his gun “Well hello there pal…. You guys don’t need to shoot me or whatever!”, ""You haven't seen proof?

Are these aliens here?” “What do you mean?"", The guy gets down on all fours “What if they came here long ago and stole our technology?”, the tall man scoffs and kicks the door open and throws the lock away “That’s just dumb speculation” he says. They step inside and head deeper into the facility. As they get further in it seems as though no one really cares. There isn’t people running around checking for trespassers and the security cameras aren't functioning properly. That leads the couple to wonder just how many men they had snuck in. In fact, they see nothing more than staff working away making weapons. ""How did you get in here so easily?"" asks his wife and gives her husband a sharp look. She’s looking over to the left and doesn't say anything but stares intently at something.  “What?!” Says her husband confused. She runs off towards another path that winds between the building groups. Soon after entering an office full of computers sits the man's jaw hanging from his chin as he watches a slide-show presentation going back hundreds of millions of years past human civilization. All of the images he sees are of humans fighting each other, but no actual space travel was visible.

","I've read enough conspiracies on this planet for one lifetime...

It started with my grandpa's tales when I was a kid. He worked at Ford (back then it wasn't evil) but had gotten sick and tired of being lied to every day by his corporate overlords. He decided that the best way to get what he deserves was to bring those lies right to them and they could tell him what he didn't want to hear: that there are no aliens. No alien lifeforms have ever been spotted on Earth or other planets. All these claims, theories, and documentaries were false or exaggerated stories to cover up some really nasty secret, which in most cases wouldn't be anything too terrible unless someone tried to sue about it! If that happened he claimed it was all part of a grand hoax, just for laughs. They never took me seriously. My classmates laughed and called me ""the conspiracy nut"" although I did go to see UFO conventions every once in a while, always coming home without anyone believing me. After high school graduation I joined the army and learned how scary war can actually be. When I returned home, the local Ford plant fell to economic ruin and left many good Americans jobless; I went out on unemployment, not working yet another soul-sucking job. At least my parents offered some comfort and love. Soon we heard news reports talking about a military facility recently discovered in Nevada under top secrecy - Area 51, where they captured something...well, we don't know exactly what. Every few years, the place had personnel mysteriously disappearing, new buildings and facilities springing up, helicopters buzzing overhead - it was creepy shit like the CIA hiding stuff up. Then today, everything changed. A strange symbol suddenly appeared in downtown Las Vegas with words written under it. Some said it was fake graffiti made by bored tourists or people who thought it looked cool. Others knew better. Today, people lined up and crowded around the block looking at each other, whispering excitedly to themselves. It's true...it looks suspiciously like an alien head, some sort of skull with five eyes and horns protruding from the sides...and there isn't much else to say...we will now enter that area! It must be here! Let's find out what they are REALLY hiding! You guys coming?

","“It’s all true, I told you it was true!” He yelled.

The people stood up in shock as one of his friends held him down while he pointed an enormous revolver at another man. His gun had a red dot sight that looked very much like a tiny satellite dish pointing towards some strange lights dancing on what appeared to be two suns, circling each other over a seemingly solid dark ball that didn’t have any atmosphere or stars on its surface. It was exactly the same picture I saw last night when I took off my glasses for five seconds because they were blurry. Now everyone knew the real truth behind Area-Five!

His fellow conspirator laughed: “I think we should start charging admission to anyone who shows us evidence so we can get some money.” One of them then said: ""I don't wanna pay for this anymore than if you actually lived with me but sure."" The first guy continued arguing that this proved our country's leaders conspired with alien governments for thousands of years so they wouldn’t lose Earth. Someone else then chimed in about how aliens must live among us as well (or even that there are aliens living within us, though I personally reject that theory) and someone called him dumb. At least half of the group started laughing.  All except one: a stocky dude in a tinfoil hat pulled tightly around his head so hard sweat oozed out of the gaps in between the creases began weeping in fear. They couldn’t possibly hide everything! This wasn’t the best conspiracy ever, no it had gotten worse by far...but not worse enough to scare these guys off! I guess I was wrong about that.

The whole town thinks I am crazy for calling out Area 51 when they are supposed to have taken our fathers. Some claim it is because his name was released while he went missing during WW2 before he disappeared so it was never investigated properly- though I think he just ran away after seeing aliens.

I know I didn't see anything then because my father is alive. We did find his wife after his disappearance though. He was taken under mysterious circumstances by those at Area 51 without her knowing and she died several months afterwards. She saw the events at Area 51 on TV with her own eyes and even gave interviews about it.

So if she believes them, and neither does, then something must be up. What is this place doing here? This town always has an answer to any question people ask us, no matter how bizarre or crazy. Something feels fishy here today. It usually only ever happens on Sundays, or some night like tonight.

But nothing felt normal. It feels like someone had been here recently, maybe it wasn't even from outside of our world. Like a man or woman might have stepped into one of those rooms down there and walked past the door. There was a strange metallic taste to everything and it reminded me of how metal often tastes when you hold it between your fingers but not exactly- there was something more prominent than that metallic taste, something else I hadn't quite figured out yet- almost indescribable...

Just then the front door opened revealing a man in a military uniform pointing at me waving a machine gun frantically, shouting in a distorted way. The most disturbing part being that somehow I could still hear him speak perfectly.

""Freeze! Police! Freeze!""""Police!""

And all I could think was, ""Wow.""

He looked panicked and stressed, but completely unharmed. And besides that odd, somewhat uncomfortable feeling in the back of my throat, nothing was wrong except the fact that he wouldn't say 'aliens' as everyone around him said every single day and he still sounded very much human.

Something was terribly, terribly wrong.

It was such a simple concept for me to figure out: all you had to do is think of something, and then try your best to live it up.  But now I was failing over again, with my brain buzzing from the lack of information on the blank sheet of paper in front of me. 

For all I knew there were people out there trying their damnedest to figure this thing out - but I was the only person who could, and I wasn't going to let it go like that!  With renewed determination I thought harder than ever before.  Trying anything really.  Suddenly a vision flashed through my mind, and I jotted down every little detail.  I decided to give myself a short amount of time to think about it, since if I didn't make progress quickly enough someone would inevitably finish first.  And if they did... well, there wasn't much anyone could do about it.

To say the least, there was no one else at school.  No other contestants or teachers either - just a single clock face ticking relentlessly, marking the precious seconds left behind us, one by one.  The teacher looked at each of us when we got back from our lunch break, his eyes shining as if he was enjoying making another miserable kid life hell.  Most kids were already beginning to panic - they wouldn't have the chance to complete everything, and those who did might not have gotten every clue right, and if so they wouldn't be getting any extra points.  Many tried throwing their pieces at random - after all what are some things that aren't important?  Of course none of them worked - after all this has never happened, neither of us had really seen a similar event happen.  However...  Oh God why do I always screw up!  Not only did these pieces work perfectly, but they also gave off clues that helped others solve theirs.  

As usual this game took longer than expected, and I'm pretty sure that many of these puzzle masters have been here longer than most.  Either way, once everyone finished submitting they began to analyze their own puzzles again.

""This guy wrote 'to find the answer think up new ways of doing things'"" said Kevin.  A student usually quiet and reserved sat staring straight ahead with furrowed brows while fiddling with a piece of pencil eraser, humming softly.  He then finally snapped into focus, ""That doesn't sound too hard..."" he muttered to himself - to everyone's surprise he actually managed to come up with something.  I guess thinking outside the box wasn't a bad idea.   There are certain times you absolutely cannot fail this test, however.  It was obvious in his case.  After he told us what the question asked (which included a bunch of different definitions for a specific object), he slowly began explaining how to correctly answer it.  When everyone started scribbling notes in the air excitedly trying to write down every single definition, it hit me: he meant words that represented objects that could be described differently, maybe even more than 10-20 ways!!  What a genius.... He was clearly working faster than the others due to a very bright and analytical mindset.  Even though his pace slowed down a bit soon after he found what he needed it wasn't too slow and he still managed to complete the entire sheet in record time.  At his fastest run in the past he completed his whole test in under an hour.  At this rate he may beat the speed records for both math and science tests that he held on his 5th grade report card.  In fact, I could easily tell he was aiming for an A+ instead of just getting a D++.  Unfortunately, the second closest competitor couldn't quite reach it - coming with one point less than Kevin's score.

The way the bullying stopped wasn't just through violence though - many were afraid that whoever they picked would be killed, especially after several others showed up mysteriously dead around that time. That fear kept most people from picking on others so that no matter how strong or brave they were they eventually lost because there weren't any other people around to assist them.

It may sound silly, but it worked wonders against bullies. There wasn't an exception to this rule - someone actually tried it against them. A few seconds later they hear their voice boom across the room ""Don't make me hurt you"". They turned on each other and immediately went down but it seemed like nothing happened. Suddenly the bully started to slowly fall apart bit by bit - hair coming off the head first, limbs disappearing then the skin and flesh before the rest of his body fell apart. It looked pretty gruesome but didn't do much as he quickly gathered himself together. Even though his form grew larger and larger he couldn't regenerate anything fast enough to stop the disintegration process. When he looked at the ground he could only see bone and meat being slowly eaten away from him. And that night he cried a huge tear before falling apart completely leaving only bones behind. No word can properly describe how terrified every other child was after the sight.


However one time everything shifted on its axis. People began finding themselves walking toward the edge of a cliff and instead of plummeting to their deaths they flew upwards. One by one the sky started to disappear below their eyes making the journey harder to understand, however their legs wouldn't let them slow down. Not even stopping did they find respite. Instead they were flung further than their bodies could endure; they got closer to god but only found death waiting for them. All of the students ran around outside looking for explanations but nobody knew why or how the situation had developed. Once the skies cleared, the only thing visible from the Earth surface were mountains but no life remained in existence because no living soul dare approach such heights. This left no survivors.

On a normal Tuesday morning we awoke to hear about how our school's new policy was to be one class per week at home. Everyone else saw this as an opportunity to go out and explore their rooms more, but not me. It seemed so stupid and arbitrary. We weren't going to miss classes by being sick or something like that. After all of my classmates had already left,  I walked into the office and asked when I could go back in for homework help. The assistant principal, who called herself Mrs. Bellatrix, made some strange noise coming from inside the walls, which stopped just as soon as I finished talking. Her body moved swiftly toward the door without her hearing my words but with enough speed to stop when she finally reached the doorway. When her arms came to full extension around her face there was no sign whatsoever of annoyance, merely confusion: ""Why are you still here?"", she said looking right past me at the empty hallway behind me.

""Well,"" I began, ""We haven't been told whether or not there will ever be another lesson, maybe next class would have a quiz or the teacher will change the date?"" This question was met with silence as I waited patiently for her to respond. 

She gave up and replied, ""Of course there will be another lesson."" As she said this several children ran in with tears down their face screaming about what they missed out while we were apart from them. I turned away from the sight of these crying children and hurried out of the building without saying anything further. Walking along the street I wondered why I went through the trouble of asking; why did I bother walking from my house at this early hour? There wouldn't be a reason now. Even though it felt good to walk around a bit I couldn't really figure out what was wrong about today's lesson since I knew nothing had changed except that tomorrow would begin as any other day. A few people decided it would probably make sense for them to visit their parents again and headed off to the local pizza restaurant before heading back to class. Other's were simply too young and confused at this point in their lives to wander even that far from home. Me, however, felt I deserved a reward for enduring all of this nonsense. And so i set myself on the path home, where after a delicious dinner in solitude awaited me...

[removed]","It felt like a million years have passed but the same cycle is never broken. You do not know what was your previous life, you were born with nothing and you die in this same way; however, it seems there's something different about the end. It will start normally, just another log entry for an ordinary man who has no idea that his death is coming up shortly...

I've been through so much since I started this program.  The first time I saw my reflection, I decided to leave, but when you are stuck in a loop of the same day, that's pretty hard. As I became more accustomed to being reborn into this person every morning, I didn't want to stop. People think I am obsessed, they can't understand why I don't try to escape. But I could do it, right? I could walk away from all this torture and be with someone else. That sounds good... but I've never had anyone, and they said if I kept going on and on like this I would become as lonely as I am today. I think there is hope of being with someone someday... perhaps after the deaths begin happening more often I can start making friends outside of this place.

I'm tired now. The sun sets below me, but even though it appears to be night out here, it must still be morning somewhere, or at least I suppose so. It's starting to get colder out here too. I wish I had worn extra clothes today. Oh well, it happens all the time.

It feels like only moments ago I woke up feeling refreshed and rejuvinated, yet here I am shivering slightly already. I remember seeing rain fall last night, and some very strong winds blowing over the ocean as well, which means tomorrow might be tough.  My breath escapes my mouth freely now because of how cold it is. If it weren't for that little old boy laughing at my boots... who knows where I would be. It makes me feel better knowing I made him laugh today! He was sitting by himself when we both came down the stairs, he seemed alone and forlorn. It's tough waiting around on a train like he was, surrounded by others talking excitedly about the snow that fell yesterday.

He sat opposite me, listening carefully to me talk and laugh as I recounted what happened yesterday. I swear I saw the frown disappear from his face. When I look back, almost every person that I have come across this week looked happy somehow. Maybe my jokes are working... maybe I should talk to them! It probably wouldn't be polite for me to start talking to people early in the morning, but I'll see what I can do. And for funsies I'll ask one question later in the day: ""Do you want to hear a joke?"" What else do these logs give me to do until tomorrow comes? They never seem to run out, and I have nothing better to do than to write the mundane entries here. At this point I'd say goodbye to everything other than my fellow passengers for entertainment, but then there isn't really anyone left here anymore. My next closest companions are the walls of the room, but they aren't nearly as exciting as talking to actual humans.


You're next. Do you want to hear a joke?

The truth wasn't much different than that of all the other logs, but somehow no one expected this reality to be our reality. That we never grew up with the knowledge that there will come a day where the people on Earth would think of us as explorers of space rather than aliens. It happened so slowly though, and soon enough everyone realized we were not welcome guests; we weren't human but... something else. The children saw the signs right away, they had evolved since the old ages: We are all connected to you, or perhaps it was us who were connected to you first?

It is just an ordinary evening, no one expects to see me standing here. Not yet at least, my family should still be asleep. My father has been having nightmares ever since he received news that the colonists were going to leave our systems. At least today, Mother and Father managed to get some good sleep after years of nightmares about leaving Earth behind, the promise of a new beginning elsewhere seemed like a false hope; too little too late once the colony ships started to arrive. In fact, it appears there were indeed rumors among the younger population of our colonies that ""things"" could enter the Earth via its moons... which most of those younger colonists ignored because of their own disbelief and denial that any ""things"" even existed. But how could someone believe that life exists beyond Earth when none can prove it? Maybe if some random scientist stumbled across it by accident, maybe if a few brave souls decided to explore it themselves - nobody knew. Now however, they don't have an excuse. Because what they do know is that these strange visitors are real and alive. There are hundreds upon hundreds, perhaps thousands already here and they are not hostile at all. So why aren't there more? They must want to be kept secret otherwise, wouldn't they? Well of course then they couldn't visit your families. So if they were watching our every move, surely none of you will ever suspect anything...

","I'd been watching the same scene repeat itself over and over from my perch on the attic stairs since 10am yesterday morning, I thought if it didn't stop soon then one of those weirdos who actually make this stuff will get the point across to their boss.  Then again maybe someone was already writing a script.

The whole family had gathered in our living room with some food out but everyone just stares at that giant TV where they normally air reruns or special events.   It takes almost an hour before anything comes on the screen after a quick commercial break.   Even when the host gets up on stage people are still staring at their computers in their office. The show is being broadcast in various rooms all around the world.  On-screen graphic tells us to tune back in later when we return.


Just as the hosts step off set a man with long black hair runs behind the curtains while his bodyguard goes into a nearby room.   After several seconds the doors open and that guy appears with a girl next to him.  He holds her arms out but she shakes them away and says ""No!""    They begin fighting, the man throws punches which aren't blocked by anyone while running through the mansion and finally corners her in a hallway... then suddenly another voice rings out saying something that reminds me a lot like...



""*Sakuya! You think this means anything to YOU?* That wasn't Sakuya's voice...it couldn't be? The first few episodes showed what seemed to be Sakuya playing an incredibly complex game against a grandmaster, right until she got herself captured.   I thought it must have been *some* weird person impersonating her but now no longer feel certain.


The man in front of the group of people laughs at his wife's comment about how much he has loved her for these years.  As the camera pans to look at a portrait above the fireplace one of the family members points down at the painting.  It shows Sakuya who winks to whoever looks at it.  The woman holding her husband says to her: *""You better hope you can beat the master here.  Last year you were completely incompetent.""*  And slowly walks off with her husband.     The master steps to the door as a single figure emerges in his place, he reaches inside his coat for a gun.

The man on the left begins to speak as they take off his hat. A bright white light appears over the stage lighting him. The lights turn cold grey and red slowly until the two shadowy figures are no longer there. 

The other man walks to center stage with his black fedora still on and speaks through a microphone. He waits to see if someone will respond to him. When he hears nothing he looks around to make sure that there is no one there then continues

","One afternoon, I was browsing a site to check some user-made stories for fanfiction when something caught my eye: *The best anime of all time!* ""Hmm"" I thought to myself as I clicked it and found that story. There were 14 pages there with no text. The first few pages only had chess diagrams of varying depths on them.

I waited for what seemed like an eternity but nothing happened so I scrolled through more pages as if I were looking at art. After a while, I finally realized that this must be one of those sites where each page was new chapter... So I read every single word in them before deciding that maybe the author wasn't able to finish the story because of writer's block or whatever and deleting the website. A little while later, while reading one of the countless online fan fiction websites, I stumbled across another. It said ""Anime Chess"". Curious, I clicked on the link only to find out that the same thing was going on here too. At least, a man had put up the same title of that story again and again. Each page would have just a simple description under the chess diagram on the page. Same pattern as the other guy!

Now, being a great observer of human nature, I knew that he had likely become frustrated that nobody has written a really good fan fiction based on the most popular game in the world. Not that they should - its hard enough just writing chess games without having to add the extra flavor of life itself into it! But there was probably someone who could do that and not suck! This is why I decided to create the fanfic in his style. I typed in ""Game 682a: Black moves after winning"" and then added the basic rules of chess. Then I started adding the twists, the suspense and the plot devices that made chess such a riveting sport to watch live. And now I sit here typing away at night staring at the monitor screen thinking about how excited I am that someone will probably pick this up next. Maybe you'll even make your own version!

*Suddenly I hear someone knocking at the door and go turn around.*
""Who in the hell knocked? And damn you are tall!""

Someone steps in and walks over to me pushing my chair back, leans back from my desk and slides his arm underneath the table so I can barely see him at all. My eyes widen and then close slightly to shock before falling down slowly toward my floor, causing the man in black to get on top of me and place a small piece behind my ear. In between my ears!

We lock our eyes in a struggle with neither of us letting go. He lifts me by my head and pushes back my eyelids to look right back in his deep brown eyes. Slowly he removes the pieces from my face so I may focus and then presses me firmly against my chair.

","**12/08/2097 - 4:33pm - The Trusting Community:**

It has been five days since our group of fifteen people agreed to let this anonymous figure, whom we have only known as ""A"", hold power over us for a month. He promises safety from sickness, hunger, and war. He does not disclose how exactly he will do it or give any explanation into what form his power will take. We still haven't actually figured out that it isn't him at all; he just holds whatever level of power allows me to see his face at a distance in person so I feel safe enough to make such a massive sacrifice. But one thing is for sure; A claims to be the last surviving member of some secret society who were tasked with protecting humanity after an apocalyptic zombie horde took over the world and wiped out nearly every other inhabitant of Earth and their place now on space stations built around Earth. That was two centuries ago by my count. I can only imagine how far we would travel to build an outpost capable of supporting life-forms that large. 

He does however claim he doesn't want to eat humans. What does that say about someone who is supposed to be immortal and possibly evil? I decided instead of killing him I should try to figure out what he is planning. After all he says he made it safely to the final stages of human expansionism on this planet. It's hard to understand why he'd choose this location specifically though. Why not colonize another planet first? One that had access to raw resources? There are no trees here save maybe a few saplings in the greenhouse section of our base. Water? Nope, water filters. Power plant? Nope, giant batteries charging under the sun. No matter where they go their solar panels never work during storms and floods occur frequently due to hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes hitting regularly. They don't need fresh air, there's pressure regulators everywhere and it is mostly purified air anyway. So where could he possibly live in secrecy, without anyone noticing? And where else might mankind end up if given unlimited energy, protection from illness and starvation, control of weapons, and knowledge on genetic manipulation? Is he even real? Should I go looking or should I just find something else to worry about and leave well enough alone?


This was meant to be an educational opportunity but he keeps making things more stressful than they ever needed to be. First its taking half the population away just to put in solar panels because nobody lives where there are forests, and then the entire population ends up leaving after they discover that the virus they created makes everyone immune to infection. Apparently the only way to stop it would be to cut the virus off before it reaches Earth but they managed somehow. Finally, when that happens he decides to show himself fully and wants all of us dead for some reason. Even worse is that he gives it to those closest to me first but never tells us why or how it came back from death to kill me...so i am immune because *i* am close enough. At least i can laugh knowing that i didn't waste anything getting infected.

","It was always assumed that Humans would be more efficient than any other race in producing technology or weapons of war. They could build ships so easily and have them repaired as quickly as it takes a man two hours on earth to fix his tie to stop it from looking so unprofessional but once the aliens got to space for the most part Earth simply threw out all their tech when it broke before even attempting to fix it. Once aboard the alien spaceship though these humans had little time to get into trouble.

Their ship was destroyed due to not having an escape pod that they properly secured and sealed so although there were no signs of violence against the human group inside every single one escaped with only a handful killed in the crossfire of the escaping craft crash landing upon the Earth after destroying each of the four remaining spaceships used by the other four races that day (though oddly enough only one of those spaceships turned into scrap metal as quickly as our own.)

Once they got aboard their second ship the humans noticed something was wrong. Their advanced language translator didn't recognize any words that had been used. For centuries this language had allowed communication between all races but this specific pair of speakers couldn't say anything in english without getting cut off halfway through. They tried everything including changing their translator chips and trying to change it back to normal English and to no avail. It appeared to work fine for about three minutes during which time they made several trips across the galaxy learning what the word ""hello"" meant and where the stars are located however afterwards it became worse rather than better again. It appeared nothing but gibberish came out of both individuals' mouths at all times except ""hello"" and after spending nearly five hundred years listening to just the word ""hello"" the aliens grew impatient and began cutting in. 

The first incident had happened within the first ten seconds of the start of the trip though luckily no damage was done as yet to either ship as they'd spent hundreds of millions of dollars making sure each vessel didn't have to hit anything to keep itself intact or to repair itself. The human crew decided it would be best to give in to them so long as things stayed put in order; otherwise the entire journey down here wouldn't go so well. Even if it did end up going horribly because of an accident involving space. To their relief there was little trouble though after twenty hours and five minutes they saw the tell-tale sign on the window. No danger and safety hazards as such though neither felt like getting out to inspect. At this point the aliens also seemed bored enough to be less confrontational in comparison. Though the passengers did realize it wasn't exactly safe at this speed despite how much their stomachs had already begun rumbling as it wasn't far below light-speed any longer and now that they were aware the aliens were capable of speaking more fluent english they wished the trip hadn't stopped quite so soon. After thirty days of traveling through hyperspace and forty days under normal flight conditions at roughly fifteen percent acceleration (the fastest they could safely move) the next signal that appeared looked alarmingly like a message in the same style their translation device used. It said: ""Welcome.""

","It had taken over 47 weeks and counting for the aliens to make contact with one of its target's planets. Its scientists have been studying it for so long that it could actually calculate where the planet was in the star chart by heart.

In the beginning, nothing seemed out of ordinary but things slowly changed over time when no new planets appeared as far away as you would expect an advanced civilization from Earth.

One day, after more than two years of failing to find a planet, the aliens finally spotted something unusual on this particular one called Earth. It was a pale blue dot sitting pretty much on the opposite end of the universe compared to how it should be.

The alien scientist studied the data he received from his probe which found out the world was inhabited by intelligent primates who are surprisingly diverse in terms of appearance as well as behaviors in comparison to other intelligent species in its galaxy. What really surprised them though was their behavior:

""Why is there a massive difference in intelligence between these primate creatures? How come most show absolutely no signs of aggression while some act aggressively towards each other and why do they seem so focused on keeping each other alive?""

*cough*

""This doesn't make any sense.""

The scientists were baffled... until they saw their home planet being bombarded by a fleet of human warships which included fighter jets, submarines, spaceships, tanks, armored personnel carriers and even an enormous laser cannon capable of destroying entire cities. They all looked terrifyingly fierce as if ready to kill or destroy everything else before them. In the center of the battle plan were four gigantic battleships; the ultimate embodiment of war machines.

What happened next confused them completely. The aliens watched in awe as the ""primates"", using what look like little stones, shot down several missiles and torpedoes aimed at them but also managed to defend themselves against lasers. Their fighters blasted into several of the warships, shooting holes in the hull to bring them to ashes without making an inch of progress against another flagship with ease, then turned back towards the rest of their army. Then came the ""fight-or-die tactics"" which was quite unexpected as the ""humans"" continued their offensive while facing overwhelming odds.

It took only seconds for them to engage all four ships, forcing humanity out of a perfect attack position. The ship captains retreated from front line engagements, firing their guns into space creating a ring of fire around their bodies before regrouping for another assault. However, this caused confusion amongst the alien soldiers who fired blindly, wasting many resources and causing casualties for a seemingly weak foe.

Instead of engaging the remaining enemy ships head-on like the initial engagement they went full fury again, this time turning off their fusion engines to conserve oxygen before launching their final assault onto the last three remaining ships. By now both sides know that they have reached a stalemate, each side unwilling to give up victory due to unforeseen consequences of losing. The humans decided to use one of their weapons last resort, nuclear strike, hoping to level the field. As expected, the impact blew open several areas in the planet leaving millions dead and billions evacuated, however, nobody thought the results would be beyond comprehension.

The humans lost *only a fraction of their number.* Every single one of them survived. Instead of being vaporized instantly, none died immediately even from explosions or radiation doses they endured. While still feeling extremely shocked about the outcome of their invasion, the alien soldiers noticed that the humans are starting to die off slowly. But not just the physical deaths, even brain activity ceased and bodies became limp within minutes with some even starting to decompose immediately.

*The result they received was nothing short of fear*:

*""They live longer than us.""*

That statement has left the planet utterly paralyzed in terror and wonder; what are these humans doing to them? How can those primates survive such extreme damage while they cannot?

","The 485th Federation Survey team walked through an abandoned town. They had just run out of water and the aliens had informed them that there was one nearby. I could only hope this 'water' could save our dying mission! The last time we saw water-infused plants here it was either a type of fungus or moss with which they used as a food source.  With the pressure on us, my heart dropped in my chest. What if they eat us? We got into our combat stances but didn't fire our weapons yet. In silence, we waited for the water...

We suddenly all looked towards a puddle in the middle of the street. It shined an otherworldly blue under our red lighting from the weapon batteries we constantly carried on us. It was almost glowing.

My comrades stood still in shock, frozen midaction. Before anyone could react, the puddle began shaking violently. With such force that the ground trembled underfoot, the puddle erupted into a jet stream of liquid at high speed. That wasn't an ordinary thing. There wasn't a drop wasted. All except for the small brown things floating down to earth.

For a few moments before everyone's eyes adjusted to the light emitted by the strange substance, each of us realized what these flying things were. These were slugs. But not normal slugs. Some sort of parasitic slug, covered in silver leaves. It landed near our feet and turned to face us with large round eyes. Our soldiers quickly approached it and made several attempts to shoot it. They missed miserably. As soon as they fired, hundreds more appeared. Then thousands. In the blink of an eye a field of insects descended upon us. Each soldier ran back and opened his helmet vent and began breathing the air directly from it. His gun never ceased firing. After the shooting stopped, two weeks later, he collapsed due to hunger. No bullets hit any living creature within range. Every human who couldn't breathe and stay alive was instantly killed. Only those inside closed helmets with filters survived.

After we had secured ourselves somewhere safe, the leader of our unit explained the danger. We are being hunted. Humans kill nature, nature doesn't wait to see how many years you have left. And today you found yourself facing a new life. A life where your instinct can destroy you.

","The ship circled closer to Earth for another recon flight.

'I think we should just end this engagement.' Said one of the aliens looking into his monitor. 'This race is clearly going to attack us in whatever way they see fit once they learn that they are being attacked'. He got frustrated and punched his fist on the desk.

'Why don't we just nuke them?' Another alien said as he was eating an apple. He pulled out a piece of paper from his bag. 

'We can't do that, they will simply adapt before I am able to detect any difference.'. A third alien replied shaking their head. 'If only there was something more we could do... maybe if we send someone to communicate with them...'

Suddenly, the other two aliens looked up and saw a figure flying down towards them and crashing on the ground right in front of the screen. The figure stood tall and walked slowly until it stood in front of the three aliens. It was human. Human technology had been developing rapidly these past few months, and soon would reach technological superiority. 

'I really hope you don't get me wrong,' said the alien next to the computer. But still everyone else didn't respond to him. Instead, a strange figure flew around the alien standing in front of it. Some kind of energy ring, spinning around it slowly. And suddenly it stopped rotating slowly. The second alien started to tremble, staring in awe at what happened. 

'No way!' yelled the third alien who was eating his apple. 'You know nothing about the concept of time, do you? That creature has become a prisoner here and hasn't seen the real Earth yet. Humans are the best in all ways! They are so peaceful! I bet I could give that silly bird over there a hug!' He grabbed his Apple and threw it at the figure, but the alien barely registered the throwing motion as he focused on seeing how well the energy rings moved around that little figure. This made him jump backward, and then fly away from everything except where the figure stood. 

A couple of days went by and after they learned each other better, the aliens decided to talk to the humans. There came many meetings held between the two races, eventually leading to both parties understanding each other fairly well. The meeting ended shortly, because none of the aliens wanted to come back.

","My eyes have adjusted to the dim room, seeing only blurry images and shadows in front of me but the screen displaying a single line across the bottom left corner is now very prominent. It’s red text on yellow background that seems to vibrate slightly and pulse with an odd frequency.

“ urgent need: all blood type donations…” it repeats over and over again as if reading aloud for someone who can’t be bothered to learn how long ago it had last been updated. In stark contrast to my tired face this sentence still manages to appear both angry and excited to finally find someone willing. It would have been comical if I wasn’t so goddamn exhausted.


After decades working at a hospital, dealing with patients being dragged off into the morgue when their vital signs were still dropping from one minute to the next by the time I was called to assist with the autopsy and paperwork associated with that situation I’ve learned a thing or two about what you’re looking at. This could be the last bit of meat remaining after your own demise has happened to you or someone else. You pray that isn’t you, and if not praying then hoping desperately they made use of it before someone took it away from them… 

A couple days after coming back to work however I realized why doctors have become less common; some people never come to their senses in between going inside an exam room for a doctor’s appointment and hearing the doctor tell someone “well there goes the guy” that there is simply too much happening in the world now. Doctors are more afraid of getting outmatched than anything else. 

Being in such close proximity to death day in and day out can make even the most hardened professionals afraid to face reality when confronted with the potential end of your career because you might not be able to live through whatever the shit ends up being. For those with strong enough morals to stick it out until retirement (or suicide) that’s what happens. But since the general population doesn’t care that much about morality anymore it really does seem like nobody wants to hear what they need to know once they walk down here and see the numbers listed on this notice

As for me, I want nothing more than to continue helping people because honestly every interaction I’ve had without knowing how close I am to becoming the patient actually gets my soul shining brighter and brighter. 

So thanks to whoever put this up but please don’t fuck that up.

","""I don't know why I applied for this position,"" said Gary, as he stood at the front counter with two plastic cups in front of him: one empty and one half full of sparkling cherry red blood. ""It was supposed to be fun! What happened?"" He said as he poured into cup number one a handful of red glitter that seemed to pulse like beating hearts in his hands before placing it back down on the stack of empty cup next to it, which would take up more space when the time came. He had been an intern for only four years now and even then they promised unlimited access to blood from donors and a full understanding of human psychology and biology in exchange for working every other shift. How were they paying his taxes?  

The rest of the room went silent as a woman entered in an all red uniform, she looked like she carried a sword instead of a pencil, but her words echoed through the room nonetheless: ""*ALL VAMPIRES MUST TAKE A BLOOD PRESSURE READING AT LEAST ONE TIME PER SHIFT*. THIS IS NOT TO MEASURE YOUR BP IN ANY HUMAN MANNER. *YOUR BAT FORM WILL BE TAKEN AND ADDED TO THE CHART*."" 


""Well, at least my paperwork is still current,"" Gary mumbled. ""How can she do this!?"" Another nurse walked out just behind her, holding a large tablet while yelling at the same time: *""THIS IS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT ENTERING YOUR BLOOD TYPE WHEN MAKING AN ACCOUNT HERE. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR TYPE BY THE TIME THIS TABLET STARTS FILLING OUT EVERYTHING IN THE DATABASE YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY US.*"". He stared wide eyed.

Gary quickly found another job after a short period of depression following his experience. The vampire world must have some kind of medical plan for how all its members get covered under insurance or something; he couldn't figure out what the rules actually were though. So many questions swirled in his mind as he left.

","“Damn,” I muttered as a small group gathered around me, their faces filled with hope and trust. “It wasn’t exactly a secret how much you drank.”

“No need to worry about that anymore,” responded one of them as her hands gently grabbed my arms and turned me over onto the makeshift operating table before her. She smiled at the other members of the coven beside her. 

I looked back and forth from the blood bags stacked behind her with fear in my eyes, and noticed the worried look on my daughter-in-law’s face as she saw for the first time what our profession really was. 

Her body lay crumpled next to us, lifeless and pale. The dark circles under her eyes only intensified as we laid her out. It was all just so real after all; her death had been very sudden. This is why I needed it so badly...

She was carrying my great grandchild; he was but 3 months old and barely learning to crawl; if his mother died now then he would be left without any support and would never learn the ways of a hunter. We just didn’t have enough funds or resources to give him up to adoption!

","It's not the perfect cover-story as I had thought: ""You are the greatest threat to humanity"" it would go...or maybe not!

To this day they think that what little they know about me is enough, but we've been at war since 1983 now and they have yet to stop me. There are countless weapons like mine out there still--and more will be created. They cannot kill me as long as I keep changing my story every time a new government agency pops up. It worked so well for years but today was different; everything went wrong perfectly and I finally got away. It was an accident though...a stupid mistake on their part, a rookie mistake that sent them into hiding right back where they belong.

I came upon them by chance. I knew no other way, even if it meant facing down those who were watching and awaiting my arrival all these years. After all, I am one of many, after all...but they were the weakest link. Even one man of my power could take them down without much effort. It took me only one night and five attempts. The final attempt ended quickly and painlessly as he tried to reason with me. He just doesn't know how terrifyingly powerful a child can become when raised by killers. All he saw me as was another monster trying to hunt him down--he never seemed to see me for who I truly was. But it didn't matter. With my hands inside his body, nothing stood between us now.

I watched his life slip through his fingers like sand while he struggled to stay alive. His screams felt foreign to me, a taste of human emotion I had grown to loathe over the ages. They always try to give off a look of sorrow for their lost children, for the ones who don't get killed but only escape--their innocence is a terrible lie and any human can tell them apart from each other. Mine looked different than those of others though; I don't want humans to survive this encounter. To live among them again knowing I am behind the scenes, playing God and manipulating events against them forever would break me. Their misery makes me happy. This wasn't a sacrifice or some sort of divine punishment on earth. This was something different from a man with a gun in his hand seeking his revenge against his son. Or whatever form the human brain takes--no matter which god you worship. If anything, it was a strange comfort to watch how quick I was able to turn myself into my own executioner. No guns used. Just a simple knife and that was done with. The last thing the father ever said before he died was the words his family always called him: *son*. He couldn't handle living without his son anymore because all these years ago it never seemed important to ask--was he really his son? In fact, it took years for him to understand what the situation was all about when my story became impossible for him to believe and once believed he couldn't fathom understanding why the authorities couldn't believe my claim that I was indeed his creation. He told the whole world this information, despite seeing the evidence myself--but no one believed him either. Some may say he just wanted attention and praise but there wasn't any truth in that; he was just tired of running and hiding. 

All he wanted was for someone to believe him, to actually recognize the truth of what he'd gone through the past fifteen years--even though nobody will now--because the government denied everything. It wouldn't end up mattering whether they did or not anyway because nobody knows the truth of what happened that evening in '02. Everyone believes that the agents were dispatched from Washington DC but here they were dead in their base in Germany instead--it was just the work of the FBI agent who discovered them in October '05 at midnight PST.

","The door was always black, but today I saw color. Crimson. My whole life felt as though it had been ripped out by my mother’s hand leaving me alone at 2 years old with nothing but this. The plastic case lay on its side now that it wasn’t glued shut anymore; there used to be a lock that held back two halves of the case together and after all these years they still hadn’t fixed it when moving me.

“It’s okay honey,” she said so softly it sent shivers down my spine despite the cold and dampness outside. She’d say so much to me every day when we were moved - *you will be fine* - I hate her voice but it does make sense.

There was more light here than I had ever seen before in the world. It came from something behind me: the lights flickered off when I turned around, the only thing left illuminating the room beside me was an incandescent bulb hanging near the ceiling from wires coming off a wall outlet. The wire that powered the bulb led to the other half of the plastic case, revealing the metal bolt that would unlock another door and allow me access beyond the walls of my small room.

Something stopped her movement, as if someone hit the brake pedal. All the doors slammed shut, sealing any chance of escape until somebody opened them again or forced them open for some reason. “You see? Now you can go wherever you want!” She cheered. A single tear slid down her cheek and landed onto a piece of paper I could read now for the very first time; the front page of *the Chronicle*. The newspaper showed the headline:

","I'd been watching him forever now. The way he moved was unnatural. He sat at his desk and just didn't move. It seemed like there wasn't a soul contained within that unmoving form.

Then it came. A man walked past me at 4am on my floor while I slept and started laughing with glee, as if he had done something magnificent and impossible. The world is full of such people: self centered and obsessed with how much they are appreciated by others. He continued along this imaginary path till he reached my room and burst into tears, still talking about what an accomplishment he had achieved.

How could anyone be so stupid? What did he think would happen when he left my door open for 30 minutes last night? Did he even know he was putting a child in mortal danger by leaving his doors unlocked?

His eyes welled up. And I thought, ""Oh good... here we go."" Just when I thought I was free of my captor, no sooner than he decided against going to work today, he gave away our whole plan. For years he fooled himself and other inmates in the facility but not me. Why wouldn't I see through all this? How naive I was! This little trick hadn't worked out the times I'd tried it before; why do I suppose he thinks he finally succeeded? 

A dark figure appeared behind him. Two hands emerged from behind him, grabbing him by the ankles and dragging him back over the threshold. I watched until I saw only dim shadows moving through what he claimed was real life. I thought of them taking me next. All these years waiting patiently for the moment he died would be wasted. Perhaps I should let him live... perhaps I shouldn't have locked the bathroom door last night though.

","“So you knew all along?"" I was shocked to find my agent staring at me with pity.

He sighed and took another sip. ""The whole world thought it's for real."" He lowered his cup, as if expecting some sort of lecture to follow. My initial surprise vanished, replaced by an angry heat. How many people have died since this thing started? His pitying look made me feel worse than anything he could say would ever.

""I think we should start over again,"" my dad said slowly, not looking into mine or my father's eyes. I didn't know how much longer I could go on like this. The last 3 hours of today had been pure agony. Every conversation was rehearsed perfectly so that nothing out of place would slip through, even while simultaneously ensuring that everything sounded exactly right. Like watching every movie that features a fake character react naturally despite being acting. It felt exhausting, impossible to do without someone noticing sooner or later. Especially knowing that I'd already seen the end scene countless times before anyone else did. For years I waited for them to screw up and finally, they did. After all of these years of preparation I realized who'd done what went wrong. That damned actor seemed to get away with a million things when it came to doing his job. But there was no chance of escape now. Everyone would know soon enough.

My mother looked at her husband, concern rippling across her face. She spoke gently, making sure her voice wouldn't break. ""He doesn't understand, dear. You need to take care of him, please."" Father sighed heavily, but agreed to help out, putting both hands upon my shoulders and gently lifting me to my feet. ""We know you want to tell him, it hurts us, really. We just...we don't want him to see what we are capable of until he is ready. Your safety matters to us more than anything."" I could tell he was genuinely worried about me, which somehow made it even harder.

They led me outside of their house. Everything went normal. At dinner, after talking over a nice meal with my parents about something completely unrelated to our situation, I still managed to avoid any clues of my true nature. By morning everyone acted normally and I continued our rehearsals for tonight's big debut. Even though I was disappointed that I couldn't talk my father into taking me back home to America. There wasn't supposed to be a second set of rehearsals, we weren't supposed to meet each other, but as soon as he walked past our building he began speaking perfect English. A few people walked past my door looking for signs, but thankfully nobody noticed. They asked me to join the group once more so I followed behind him.

We entered the theatre and saw where tonight's play was going to be shown. My heart skipped a beat. In 12 hours I was supposed to walk onto stage with thousands of people in attendance only to realize I never had to act at all. If I hadn't found them beforehand I might have continued living with them, pretending I was fine with them. Instead, my life was destroyed. And yet, deep down inside of me was that little voice that screamed: ""This isn't fair!"" No matter what happened, no matter where we went, I would always keep wondering about those 12 hours. They wouldn't let my family live any longer because of me, and they forced me to run away. It broke the most important part of me, made it crumble. All that trust, love, memories... gone!

""Here goes nothing..."" I said to myself, remembering why I was here in the first place; to hide who I truly am in front of others and leave them unaware of the horrific truth. But I also couldn't help but curse under my breath that my mission wouldn't turn into a suicide attempt, as long as no one knew.

Once again, I stood alone. Tonight, there were none of the familiar faces of my family among the audience. I sat silently throughout the opening night's performance, but it was far more unbearable than I originally expected it to be. Each laugh from the audience, loud applause during key parts of the show, screams during scenes full of suspense... each detail that my superiors tried to keep hidden was brought straight to light. This time, there was no reason to hold back anymore. When the final curtain fell, I knew what I had to do. So I stepped forward and ran off the stage. No one stopped me, of course - after 15 minutes I returned. One more time, I stood at the edge of the stage, staring at the empty seats that were supposed to await me. With shaking hands I raised a hand towards my ear piece, hoping to make contact with someone. Someone needed to come to my aid, someone needed to rescue me. There was no answer on the line, not even silence as a consolation prize. Disappointed, yet determined, I left the auditorium running past security guards into the street below, heading out onto the streets of New York City seeking some form of solace.



That very moment my phone rang, vibrating against the side of the floor beside my seat. I stared at the phone on the ground and cursed myself for holding it there, letting curiosity lead me astray. I grabbed my phone, the phone with the camera lens that wouldn't stop flashing bright pink as I picked it up, trying to figure out who could possibly be calling me right now. It was probably Michael, either his new girlfriend Claire or his annoying younger brother Patrick. Picking up the call, I mumbled ""Hello? Who is this?"". An eerie calm seeped its way into my voice as I heard the familiar chuckle, the echo of a voice filled with both confusion and shock that quickly turned into determination. It was him. I was relieved, yet furious. He was asking me who I was when I had told him who I am. ""Why are you calling me?"". He stated casually and then abruptly hung up. Still shaken, I looked down into my phone again, seeing the call had ended shortly after starting. Did he notice my identity as well? Where the hell am I going to run? Am I trapped? Is the police involved somehow?

","A faint humming filled my ears, and I felt myself turning from one side of the white box to the other as light shifted from darkness. In fact, it was very bright on both sides but when you were able to distinguish the color blue around me, suddenly the white walls had changed into something else that was much more pleasant: black with red borders and the ceiling turned green along with another change--a glowing floor now lit every single point of time that my eyes saw.

I did not see a wall across from mine. I was surrounded by trees in all directions and their leaves rustled gently even though there was no wind anywhere I could see. A small road snaked through them with cars driving down its main artery at an un-natural slow pace. Then my vision took in a little island where two large mountains sat back-to-back forming part of a long lake, and further down the water flowed with what must have been rapids. I opened my mouth again and looked for some water...as if I was thirsty after sleeping so long (that would be true enough!). But I soon found out I wasn't tired. That and that everyone around me seemed to be doing just fine without any food or drink either; they were eating breakfast together. Or lunch or dinner...when exactly I couldn't quite tell yet since none of the surrounding buildings or roads bore a date or year on them. 

The only thing consistent about this place (and the one factor that kept everything else so familiar) was the way people went by walking briskly down a street towards each other; stopping then talking with others and laughing once the conversation concluded. Each person walked differently too; some sported clothing suitable for working outdoors while others had suits. One male wore clothes clearly tailored for sitting while reading, others worked at desks making things out of metal, like tools. Someone wearing a brown coat hung his head low, clutching a briefcase and looked sad whilst someone carrying a heavy toolbag rushed by without breaking eye contact, shaking her ass as she ran. The colors weren't perfect either--some places I went I would go grey and others remained pink with a purple tinge to them; otherwise the scene continued to grow darker in several shades. All of it made me sick as a dog; why hadn't I become an evil man yet? I wanted answers and if the first thing in life was asking questions why did I look so disoriented and pale in comparison to the others???



As I got into shape slowly over time and realized these people didn't care how I acted, I noticed many shared similarities; most were bald except for the guys who looked old and worn down whilst holding briefcases full of files. Their faces were different although a few were shaped similarly; most were round and fleshy unlike mine that wasn't. I remembered having such a body before I closed my eyes in bed one final time that day! They looked nothing alike though with differences ranging from skin complexion to hair color. Some were tall while others squatted almost comically--one guy looked like I'd always seen him do when drunk looking as if he had never moved a muscle in his life. Many seemed to be young whereas others showed signs of getting old which gave off a strange feeling but the closest to my self came to being the taller than average female I woke up beside. She was beautiful of course in a classic blonde beauty kind of way...but what truly impressed me more was her lack of breasts! Her figure somehow looked soft instead of hard/athletic, but maybe I should put emphasis on softness--maybe we can be more friends haha. And that's kinda cool. I thought back at how I knew this face--oh yes I recognized her from back at work. The guy behind her did too I think and stopped mid step. He pointed at us with no verbal inflection and went to her. We didn't talk at all. It was obvious they recognized us in a matter of seconds. Who had gotten better genes than the rest of humanity?!?! My hand brushed against his arm--why was it cold? There was not a reaction from the man that met my gaze and a few seconds passed--then he pulled himself away and we joined those already in our midst and began walking forward while smiling as humans do.  So I am sure I know what happened here because even the doctors told me so but let me explain why I feel bad about what I believe happened, if anyone still reads this.

There were tons of clones of each person everywhere--there were probably thousands of us. Not only are they everywhere--we don't know who we are or what they might've done. If *he* had died before I awoke here I might've known what *I* did last. Instead of waiting to find him though I followed his lead while trying to remember. When I caught up with him, we shook hands and then he smiled and gave a little shove. We parted ways briefly and started heading to where *he* appeared to walk towards the mountains nearby to get coffee. What am I supposed to do now?!?

","I awoke to a feeling I've never felt before: emptiness. I stood up, put on my slippers and went into the shower... there were no other people here, so I got dressed in an oversized shirt, put down the slippers at the foot of my bed, took out my phone and started scrolling on facebook when I stopped for just one second.

When I had come home from the lab the previous day, they told me that because this was only my third attempt at creating a human clone, that their safety precaution would be strict -- but they said nothing about how strict those precautions would be. I could have sworn that I heard them say ""If something should happen to him, please do not blame yourselves, nor us"" or some such variation... which might mean that whoever they sent with me to monitor my progress knew what they were doing. That thought seemed plausible, too, especially as soon as I stepped back outside and looked around. It wasn't the same building as the research facility; it was more of a private villa. No security cameras or microphones were obvious, and when I turned off my phone (still being unable to log back on) I went further down the street to the corner store where the vending machine gave me a soda and bag of chips, assuming I don't kill myself first. Well, by the time I realized who I am sitting across from, I'd lost both the ability to think and use a smartphone. The room door opens slowly, and a figure walks out, a woman whose beauty reminded me exactly of my twin brother, except she was wearing a white jumpsuit instead of his blue shorts.

She didn't speak, her eyes darted around the room like mine did last night until they locked onto mine again. But then the moment passed, the stare was broken, she smiled softly and ran right over to me. ""Oh thank god,"" she laughed, ""you can finally talk."" She pulled off the mask, revealing to me her soft brown hair. ""Hi, um, i-i'm Jennifer,"" she said, shaking me slightly as I lay in the bed. The voice rang in my ears, yet all I saw was her face - I couldn't distinguish her face. Then I remembered that if our genders matched we would not be able to recognize each other. ""Jen..."" I whispered the name in response. ""Jennifer? Is that your real name?"" she asked, taking a step closer to me, her touch sending shivers through my body. She held my face and tried desperately to kiss me, but I flinched away; the coldness of her lips against mine burned hotter than any kiss I ever felt from someone else. When I broke free of her hold, I rose up to a chair and spoke again.  ""No, you know why I'm calling you that, you know how I feel - don't lie to me!"" I hissed, trying desperately to keep my voice under control; I was still shaky and my whole body felt cold, like something died inside of me as I fell hard upon my knees. She opened the door, stepping out of the way and making sure no lights were left on. 

The hallway light blinded her momentarily as I closed my eyes tightly and waited for everything to fade away. The door clicked shut behind her and I opened my eyes to find she had left, but there was a small piece of paper on the floor near the sliding doors leading out of the house: My name, written on the page in a splotchy cursive font.

","""Your father,"" said the voice, ""told me to tell you he wasn't coming.""

""So... why did I get this letter?"" I mumbled as I looked over at my brother with confusion. We were both sitting here alone, on each of our own beds, reading different letters. They all looked incredibly depressing and written by an old man who had probably gone blind years ago but somehow was able to write out these extremely specific instructions about how his life went wrong, without knowing which person the actual writer of it was. 

I slammed down the crumpled note and pointed towards him. ""I have no clue why I got this letter!"" I yelled. He merely shrugged nonchalantly and continued with his readings. The first letter stated: 'Go to North America'. It ended at that and seemed like a fairly normal advice. I didn't even need to look where I stood, just knew it was some kinda office or something, judging from the windows and walls around.

The second one asked for me to go south instead. Again nothing to worry about there. But this one had much longer text than those ones before it, giving directions across multiple countries, ending somewhere in South America, near the coast. Another shrug for him and another quick check for his surroundings - his face told me that he was confused about what should be done. Was that possible? How could we possibly do everything they specified?

In the third letter I started getting paranoid, the location this time mentioned Antarctica. A continent not so far away from Russia! Was this thing actually sent by my dad from Alaska? I checked my phone again, only now I noticed my message hadn't been read. Just then I realized; Dad never wrote us letters. Not real ones anyway. This was probably meant to be received personally when we woke up. What kind of crazy stunt would he pull with this fake letter he couldn't send himself? He must've picked random people on the internet, saw their address and wrote them off. So then he sent someone else his message and they showed it off online - maybe it was funny, maybe it sparked some sort of debate. No way was that it though. That letter made me think too hard. Maybe I forgot about being an early morning news junkie earlier today. What if everyone found Dad's story true? Like some kind of global conspiracy to escape Earth because aliens tried to destroy humanity. Or maybe, just maybe, all men decided to flee Earth once and leave behind their offspring under the expectation that they might come back someday. If Dad was one of the lucky bastards that came back, then he most definitely wouldn't want to meet anyone left alive from the past. Even if those people were his relatives.

The fourth letter told me to run eastwards and immediately west after hitting Siberia. From Siberia it should lead back home. That finally made sense. When I stopped reading it and looked at my twin brother, he was staring straight ahead with the same unreadable expression that I had seen since I woke up. My heart sank. ""What the..."" I stammered. He shook his head and put down his book. We looked at each other for a long moment, waiting for words. 

But neither dared to say anything. Neither cared anymore.

","I awoke from my coma, I felt sore everywhere, it seems there's been something going on while I was unconscious. The first thing I notice were 2 things; one of which was the smell coming off of my body. It smelled like cheese and garlic, kinda weird, not gonna lie.

As soon as I opened my eyes I realised where I was... at the hospital. Right, the incident with the plane had knocked me out for quite awhile! In order to save himself and his daughter, both myself and his pilot had taken bullets to the chest as they did a emergency landing on an empty airfield just outside the city, but luckily we both survived. Thanks to his wife, the love of his life having the same idea she suggested the best possible way to save her man by trying to pull him from death, it worked (she also donated the kidney because if the girl hadn't been saved due to the surgery they wouldn't have had enough organs to help either!)


The doctor came through he looked really happy ""so tell me again Mr. X what do you see?"" He asked. His voice was calm and relaxed. I didn't understand until a few seconds later why this could be so calming.

""I see... me"" I said back to him looking down at my torso.""I don't feel anything though,"" I added still feeling pain in my ribs from when the bullet passed through me.

After further checking from other doctors who had brought Dr. A.M over I found myself in another room ready for another examination, a team walked out only moments later and handed me to another staff member. I took a look around and saw an identical double staring me straight into the eyes. That time I started questioning whether or not my sight might be playing tricks on me.

When the man picked me up and tried to speak I immediately knew it wasn't me talking I replied instead:""What?"" In response the doctor came forward and spoke calmly""It seems that your brother has died sometime ago, but you may have become confused. Your brain has fused with yours before you went onto being pulled from the wreckage. Your blood type was too similar to yours, hence why you two are able to fuse your bodies. Thank you for saving his life as part of your payment the world owes you one dear friend!"" As he finished speaking an old woman stepped forward. My heart skipped a beat seeing her familiar blue hair. She hugged me tightly and shook my hand as I stared shocked at my face in reflection

""Welcome home,"" she whispered into my ear as tears streamed down her cheeks. I looked from my hands to the floor then back to the woman that brought me into this world. Her words sank deep within me as my consciousness faded away forever. At last my sister had arrived here with me.

","As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting its fiery breath across London's rooftops, so did I rise from my penthouse apartment.

I looked out at the city, the people who were going to bed early - their homes nestled snugly against walls of brick and stone. Homes that were probably safe enough tonight. It was one of those days where I felt like someone would catch me up before daybreak. But for them, I didn't have anything to say. I was just some old man who couldn't take another second on this Earth without hurting something or someone. The streets weren't meant for men such as myself; there were too many innocent hearts within easy reach when we walk upon them. 

""It isn't even that hard, is it?"" The voice started in my mind, low but heavy with emotion. ""Just shoot me."" Then came the words that hit more powerfully than any gun: ""Please tell them that you love them."" It had been decades since they had gone and left me alone. My only constant companions now were my memories. Memories of her touch, her smile, her laughter...and the bitter taste of betrayal that followed our breakup. She should be here next to me. We shouldn't have separated. We shouldn't have fallen apart. And she shouldn't have left with everything she loved most - us. 

My fingers reached for the revolver strapped to my ankle, placing it between two toes - my right thumb resting on the trigger guard. A single press released the cylinder with all sorts of bullets clanging into one another. An audible bang made sure I got the job done quickly. 

I took a last look around the room. Everything except the television lay in shreds around me. Another one of her favourite shows - some reality soap opera where nobody died - watched over them all. I turned and walked out onto my balcony and let the wind pick up, dragging along pieces of my heart. And I waited, wondering if my beloved could be watching over those same memories.

","“This city is so dirty and filthy! It's disgusting!” I yelled out as I stepped on the curb to stand over our newest victim, who lay writhing in pain, clutching at their neck from a broken bottle wrapped tightly around it. The man fell to his death right before my eyes, another body added to the pile of nameless horrors that cluttered the sidewalks like garbage.

I had no real feelings for him, I simply found him amusing when he came into the building where I worked every morning and demanded more pay because his girlfriend was too much of an emotional wreck to help clean up after her mother took care of the dishes every day and therefore wouldn’t clean them herself. In my book, they should just marry each other or something, since that seems to be how all people stay together anyway. Or maybe both should just live off his wages. 

His father died six weeks ago due to being struck by a truck which made me even more eager to get rid of this useless man. If my manager saw the dead body she didn’t notice (or perhaps we were busy enough that no one noticed) or the man who tripped on a cigarette butt that someone dropped (because obviously, people everywhere have smoking habits without thinking and throwing butts anywhere) then there would have been no problem. But somehow the police became interested.

The sirens came first; you know how cops are always here before anyone else. Then the flashing lights followed—always flashing red and blue, so pretty but not very useful. And finally, officers in various uniforms arrived, bringing guns and badges and barking orders. I wasn’t particularly bothered. All those gun-carrying things can easily shoot an innocent soul dead if they want to.

They questioned us about what happened while two officers led one man away. They asked me if anyone could tell me anything relevant but luckily for everyone, no one except the janitor knew how many times I stabbed a worker that night (twice, twice to be exact). So now some jerkoff will go through whatever trouble he has to go through to find these knives, hopefully ending up with nothing but a black eye. That is exactly what happens when you mess with people I respect. You don’t end up knowing everything about their past, though.

My boss called me stupid when I finished my shift. Stupid? My name is stupid? How dare she do that—I told her I would never forget. When I did her stupid desk job next she was quiet for the longest time as she wrote something down, probably to write a good review of me somewhere. Later on she said: “Now get back to work! Stupid idiots always leave dirty dishes in the sink.” At least that part I understand; cleaning them myself actually makes me feel better about spending my days watching people suffer. Especially annoying ones.

People tell me ""everyone has someone they could never forgive"" And when my best friend passed away 8 months before I entered this world, my mom says she did too: She blamed the guy.

It wasn't really an insult at first... her words kept saying how badly I had screwed up her life because of him... like if one person could ruin everything there would have been something more, a monster!

I got mad and yelled at her ""Mom, everyone has things to do wrong! You wouldn't need us if you hadn't tried so hard!"" She just gave me my damn phone back and told me ""You better make sure it pays off""

I still think about what people mean by it though... now looking back on these last 7 years... I can't see any good reason for Mom to even be here... I guess I should just forget she said that thing about revenge, as far as I recall most people agree with it..

So let's not dwell on those memories right, and we will have an extremely long story in order to get you ready... There was nothing that truly made sense until recently where I figured out the plot twist. It all sounded like such a coincidence, that it couldn't possibly be true - especially since there was always another excuse somewhere. But it doesn't matter anymore.

They were both idiots: He took advantage of them without remorse and ruined their lives by making every single decision possible so that he could feel complete power over everyone else, but he was never gonna break free. The fact that he finally broke it feels almost surreal considering how oblivious he actually seemed while doing whatever the hell he wanted...

And then I found a way to reverse engineer his code.

As if my past trauma needed *another* blow, but this time I realized its meaning and understood my fate as I learned from it. Like a detective, except instead of looking for a clue I became addicted to finding flaws so hard I couldn't even escape.

My girlfriend scoffed. She knew better than anyone that we had no chance. There were not enough supplies on board to reach the other side of the galaxy in just ten years. And there wasn't even a signal from them, let alone an answer. This mission was suicide, and everyone agreed. But something prompted her to push forward with the technology - something she couldn't explain herself.

We launched into space to find a way to reverse our time dilation so we could safely return home while carrying life support for all of us onboard as well as every scientific sample possible. Even though it took over thirty billion cycles for the two ship to finally achieve faster-than-light travel they managed to keep track on what direction they traveled and how much closer we got to their universe via some sort of quantum communication system built into their ships.

After twenty billion cycles or so - because humanity would need a large chunk of food on this trip since food production stopped back on Earth centuries ago (we learned what happened to plants in long exposure to microgravity) - the ships finally activated FTL again, but to our shock they did not appear where predicted. We expected the same outcome as before, but instead we found ourselves near one of their asteroid belts. They explained the FTL technology and its limitations by pointing a single pointed finger to their navigation console; you see, their ship malfunctioned due to some technical defect in the FTL drives themselves - causing it to be more efficient in traversing vast interstellar distances rather than smaller ones.

After traveling through those asteroid fields the ship disappeared again, only this time when our team tried to get another response out we didn't hear anything. For weeks we waited for any answers until eventually the entire vessel turned around and returned to home. It reappeared after nearly a thousand cycles. No damage was sustained and the crew returned to us with stories we didn't believe yet. Every story we received confirmed something we already suspected: we were not truly alone. The Universe was a lot larger and stranger than we ever imagined. It is difficult to describe your emotions when meeting aliens. Especially considering we are essentially animals who don't know why our existence was given purpose in the first place.

As such, we set off the moment a small group of them appeared near the nearest star system to ours. As usual - within less than a minute - each member of the original crew went missing without leaving behind any trace whatsoever. They were greeted with open arms, which soon grew colder. Soon enough they realized that the universe is far bigger than either of us thought it would be. Humanity will never feel safe inside our own Galaxy if there are still alien species like these in the void. And it may never be peaceful unless humanity gets stronger, smarter and wiser.

I opened my eyes only to see nothing. My legs twitched as I felt for my bedpost and pressed myself back onto familiar wood and steel. At first it took me nearly ten minutes before I got up and began to run down the halls of the massive aircraft carrier. People were everywhere, some sitting in their seats watching something on the screen that showed the strange, alien spacecrafts in front of us. Some people stared ahead of them, others ran and cried; the entire ship felt like a living nightmare. A few groups huddled together in fear while most simply tried to enjoy the show. This is not my cup of tea. Instead I began walking through the endless rows of rooms and bathrooms until I reached the small kitchen where our mother kept our breakfast items. I grabbed her usual grapefruit juice and some muffins before joining my fellow comrades in the lounge and watched what remained of our home hurtling towards oblivion. A collective sigh ripped through the ship as my dear father spoke into his comms ""This is good news,"" he said with pride. ""You are all safe.""

Most people applauded but some turned away. Most did not believe him and neither did I. As I am writing this text I have not seen my parents since we arrived here five hundred million light years ago. Millions died during the landing attempt and many more died in the following hours as the alien forces swarmed our homes and ships killing anyone not wearing their white uniforms. Many millions have died in total due to starvation and lack of oxygen and other similar issues over these last six long months and the death toll may reach several hundred million by the time our rescue team arrives if not sooner. We should have known better than to leave Earth after centuries of scientific knowledge being stolen and exploited by these ruthless creatures, we knew that they were planning on attacking but did not want to believe. They attacked at dusk of course, the stars themselves seem to have conspired to aid them. It does seem like a bad dream I think because I wake up every morning hoping it is all still true and then go on with life. Even though it might not be my world I find solace in knowing that there must be someone out there looking for me, searching for the only boy who can travel between planets via hypergates or anything else. If it were not for those things our chances of survival would have been zero. You know why? Because humans are stupid. That's right, Stupid is our middle name. And no one ever really knows where that comes from. But we do know what stupid means. The short version is that it refers to a person whose actions or decisions are foolish, irrational or illogical. There is an important point to making this remark, you ask? Yes there is. After what happened to us I am starting to wonder if we aren't fools for leaving earth. After all what could possibly make humans so stupid?

When I last saw him he was laughing, his eyes gleaming with the same glee as a cat catches a mouse in its paws. ""I'm starting a new race,"" he had chuckled back then ""a race of immortal beings from this galaxy who will conquer every other civilization and usher in an era where all races of man live in peace."" He laughed again. ""And if some arrogant prick wants to play that game, we'll kick their asses so hard, they'll have nightmares of dying for an eternity."" The smirk on his face had become even wider before he pulled up another bottle of beer. 

""You know you hate those space lizards, right?"" I asked, knowing full well my voice carried nothing but amusement over the comm link when he replied ""Well yeah, I do! They try to steal our jobs and shit. Those fools have a bad attitude!"" We would continue drinking for hours like this, discussing anything and everything except Earth politics. As humans, we never really talked about what we were fighting against, let alone how much of ourselves the enemies we faced took away. That was not something we should discuss. It just became second nature. One day he left. At first, I thought no one was going to miss him, hell everyone seemed happy about it - especially me. Then came the next wave of recruitment, only worse this time around. You see my friends have been recruited. There are 4 million left now, all armed soldiers trained by the greatest minds (and strongest dicks) in military history. Only 50% were strong enough for combat training yet most were capable enough to blow each other apart with a single strike. And here is where things got weird: Our greatest warrior was chosen to lead us. The idiot knew exactly what he was doing because no matter how many of his friends died in training there would never be enough men for him to ever lose; however his body had stopped growing and his brain wouldn't evolve. His hair began turning gray and he forgot more and more and became increasingly bitter. What better way than to use the one thing that kept him alive - his mind - instead? Of course none of them cared, or maybe they did, but pretended they didn't since what they felt couldn't possibly justify murdering their former friends.

Now our army was ready, the enemy was at the gate, we could easily knock them into orbit with lasers. Or so I thought.

A strange feeling overcame me as I slowly realized that my mind had woken up to a reality where everything was different from what I remembered. When did it become necessary for us to be aware? 

The last thing I remember was waking with an itch on my leg when I walked to school one day while watching some bullies beat other people who were being left alone outside on the sidewalk because they were slow or lazy. My mother went out to find them just after and brought them back. The incident was only something she wanted to avoid by making me forget, though no matter how hard I tried, I always remembered it so clearly that I didn't feel any pain even now. This made it all the more impossible to imagine why my memory seemed corrupted; but then again, nobody told me that sleep was never really an actual sleep. Maybe this was like the ""dream world"" everyone spoke about, which I found extremely unbelievable since it simply wasn't possible considering technology at the time hadn't advanced far enough to do anything beyond mere virtual reality experiences. How could you know someone is dreaming unless they come home before you go to bed? It made sense though if you think about it too hard. People in their dreamland can choose whatever comes to mind, including sleeping and not sleeping. No dreams or nightmares were allowed! As long as there were no real feelings involved you weren't supposed to notice them anyway. Why else would our parents tell us we were experiencing vivid dreams in order to prevent us from getting into trouble?

What bothered me most was this new feeling - the realization that our entire society knew and embraced those around us for the life that we lived. They seemed happy about it, but also ashamed of ourselves for holding onto our old ways of thinking, especially once they came up with the idea of FTL travel. At first, none of this bothered me much until I figured out why exactly it bothered us in the first place: that we had a bad habit of getting excited over things that wouldn't change much anyway. Our own lives were just moving forward despite many mistakes we'd made along the way. Those trips to Mars should have stopped once it got boring - or at least it should have been more than one trip because I don't remember that well either. In fact, the reason why many of our societies failed was simply because we couldn't keep up with advancements due to our slow nature. Nobody wanted to give up what they already had, nor did they want to understand what might benefit them in the future. This meant that FTL travel had probably just happened yesterday since people thought the whole thing must have gone away eventually.

I stood there as I heard voices shouting above the roar of my heart. I couldn't help but smile as I finally understood. If I went to space I would likely see my classmates from school running away from each other screaming; but instead they started greeting each other. Their bodies relaxed and they began to laugh and hug one another without hesitation. Instead of sadness filled frowns, joy radiated from everyone. This kind of experience had occurred multiple times now ever since the FTL spacecraft arrived 1500 years ago. All these past incidents had taught us a valuable lesson - every generation has its own struggles to overcome, and no matter how painful they seem today, they will ultimately serve as stepping stones towards the next big step.

","No one saw this coming. It took centuries but we eventually ran out of people to try and plant those seedlings of Eden once more.  Even then no one seemed to be able to kill it off, its spores kept appearing everywhere on earth!

And what started as something like an agricultural project, soon turned into a race war between the two dominant super-powers in Eastern China and Japan.  We thought the conflict would end with a bang. It didn't.  It ended with an even greater bang of biological warfare than anyone could have ever imagined. The seed had spread like wild fire around the globe, changing everything about every person in half a billion years time. 

I had become president shortly after I came out to my government officials that our situation wasn't looking so good.  ""There are now millions upon millions of tree people roaming the Earth,"" one of them said in my office at 2AM ""Do you really think they will listen to any messages? Do you think we can win?"" Another official asked incredulously before going back to sleep on his couch.  I tried explaining the nature of the problem, how much worse things were now than when it all happened just a couple generations ago, but there was nothing anyone else seemed to be concerned about except the fact I was trying to get something accomplished. This kind of thing shouldn't have to happen. Someone had to find some way to stop it.


We went through so many men and women, over a dozen presidents (me included) but no solution could survive beyond the first week with each new administration. No one dared bring their loved ones to work anymore after that day.  But I knew if they did they wouldn't blame me or our leadership team or anyone else. They would blame themselves. And they would be right; there was absolutely no way to do anything except put ourselves in front and convince everyone that this is why they need us to be their leader. We weren't leaders, we were puppets. None of the candidates wanted to talk about it, not now anyway, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.

My last day as President came yesterday - my replacement hasn't actually finished getting voted in yet, but he'll probably win by noon today at the latest. But my predecessor couldn't let me slip away this easy: ""Look, look, this isn't your fault."" she whispered into my ear over coffee before leaving my door.

I stopped making eye contact and closed my eyes as I waited for her words to catch up to her actions. My staff stood ready to escort me out, I didn't mind being given a second chance as President of these United States after being forced to resign because of that stupid goddamn incident with the press conference during the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II where I tripped and broke my ankle.  So long as the public remembered that I didn't intentionally do it, I don't think it would hurt me. Maybe I could win the election now that I hadn't made any claims for reelection since becoming President. I sat down and pulled out a crumpled pair of sunglasses from my pocket and tried to fix myself, hoping to distract my eyes for at least a few minutes to regain my composure. When my staff was done bringing us food, I looked back to see if I had messed something up, and I had. 

I smiled back slowly, revealing my chipped front tooth. A smile that gave me away almost entirely. For whatever reason, that image was enough for someone else in the building to realize there was something wrong. Two armed agents swarmed me and cuffed me in seconds flat, taking me across the room while my staff looked confused and my successor paced nervously in her seat behind the podium next to mine.

","The first thing I knew was pain. A throbbing in my head made me moan with pain and force my eyes open, then it all clicked into place. ""Where am I?"" I asked myself as I sat up on the grass that was right next to a large tree behind me. Trees around me were too far away but there was this massive tree near me that had something red hanging down at low. Curious to what it could be I ran over towards it and touched it gently and heard something soft crackle and break off my finger. Pain surged through my body making me drop to the ground. The berry broke into pieces revealing the fleshy seeds inside. It was red, green, yellow and black as if some sort of rainbow came out of the tree.

I didn't think much about the seed and instead decided to keep running in search of water. As I crossed paths by another tree branch a tree sprouted out of my hand, vines wrapped their leaves around me then slowly started to suck me down into the trunk. 



That night when I woke up again in a strange bed I saw them in front of me. Their faces were glowing but they seemed familiar. An elf? Orc? Elfkin? They looked like everyone. The one standing tallest had blonde hair and blue eyes. Beside him was one wearing a cape that resembled dark cloth and holding a bow and arrow and beside him wore a similar outfit but he swung an axe. And finally she had short blonde pigtails in an elaborate helmet on her head. Though i remembered seeing someone wearing that kind of suit before: a woman with pink skin with white spots and purple horns who lived somewhere in Eastern Europe, or did I dream that? Either way, she reminded me how many years ago I would watch tv and hear all kinds of news reports about different stories told by people all around the world. One day maybe someday i would see one of those things in person and actually understand it myself. But only when i closed my eyes and watched these guys walking back in forth in front of me when sleep overtook me.


""Who are you?"" I exclaimed to them when I awoke again after an hour. My thoughts still clouded by nightmares. They pointed towards themselves showing no emotion. I noticed they have weapons in hand though. At least two axes, a sword, spear and bow arrows, nothing more than wooden sticks except for the spearhead which was a metal triangle point i thought but they looked sharp enough anyway. I didn't know why, maybe fear perhaps excitement or sheer curiosity propelled me to ask them.

""What country are you from?"" I asked tentatively. When they answered neither looking at me directly nor nodding their heads. I kept asking questions without a stop until my voice gave out and the elves finished eating me up. Then they turned to each other as if they had just figured something out.

","Tonight, it's tomato soup vs chicken noodle, again

The annual ""Soup Opera"" took place tonight in their town's soup kitchen - this was supposed to be an act of love, for the homeless, and the rest of us mere mortals who had so many soups-es of despair in our lives to fill these bowls with (the actual soups). Today, however, they went sideways... I had planned the whole thing perfectly, but then came that guy. The man made his entrance like he knew about *nothing* going on there. He just walked over to tomato, placed an impossibly tall stack of bread onto its bowl, and called out:

**""Hey Soup Girls! If you guys don't mind, we can make Tomato Soup even better than you already have by adding some... chicken.""** 


I watched as everyone looked at each other, confused, not sure where to start. That's when my boyfriend told me what they did for Halloween 2 years ago. A giant bucket of cheese curds appeared from thin air, and covered every single table in Cheese Puffy. Apparently that got old quickly enough because now one of the local restaurant owners claimed the ""Curry Noodle Soup"" has become the best meal in their history, having gained tons of customers overnight. No surprise here, though -- curry is delicious and noodle is amazing. I know my wife will beat her heart against the wall if she finds out she accidentally ruined the soup opera forever. I hope those poor souls could eat half before the Curry Noodle team showed up.

","He could tell they were all listening to him. She could not see that he was staring at her. He knew she could see his gaze, though. 

""She will have me killed for this.""

""What did you expect?"" said Mrs. White's red onion soup, shaking his bowl so much that his spices spilled over. ""You told us what would happen!""

He knew it wasn't fair to them to continue acting in front of them. Their eyes watched his every move, and their silence was palpable. They didn't need to speak; everyone understood who did what when. His family. His children. They were watching how to kill him today. It took a deep breath before he continued: 

""I tried. I loved her, just like I love all of you. But when I put my heart into it, all I got was heartbreak. Just like I get each day since we fell in love.""

That little bit worked as long as nobody talked. The only ones speaking were those who wouldn't be involved with the act soon anyway. They went on talking of things they never heard anyone say before because they had always been too busy trying to eat people like them. Her husband kept spouting off about getting revenge on her husband, the man who still hadn't confessed he hadn't known her all along. A woman stood up from her seat and started chanting. Another yelled, demanding more details. And someone else asked him if he had lost anything during his marriage or any other time they stayed together.

Her voice had dropped down to an angry growl by now. And he swore they weren't going to listen. Not one ounce was left in him anymore. The first tear came then followed quickly by another one, and a new wave of grief hit him. This must make her realize he was the one she wanted to hurt. How wrong she was.

After some time it became silent once again, before suddenly an ear-splitting scream erupted throughout the room. It was John who now appeared on the table to explain how everyone had failed him. ""I should never have left my baby alone"" said John as he fell onto the ground and started breathing heavily. From behind their father came a small child, a bowl containing chicken noodle soup, asking if its brother was going to be okay.

(A one act tragedy)



**Act One:**

*Characters: The Soup Bowl. A lonely bowl filled with chicken stock and onions. (The love struck character.)
*Character: The Tomato (and its companion).
*Other Characters: 3 Men who each try to get their way into the soup that is Love.

It was going pretty well at first. 3 Guys, sitting around a table next to a large bowl of warm soup. No one paid it much mind yet they have been dating since college. But today as the evening draws closer to the end he notices something...  


""What the hell?""

And there they go again....

He watches this girl get served to him from across the room and she looks right back. Oh well I'll just sit out here until this guy runs away and leaves me alone. He slowly drifts toward her so that his body lines up perfectly across hers so when the soup bowls are passed around he can just walk on over and tell her how great he thinks she looks while everyone else is busy watching the chef making a new batch. ""I really like that little skirt you got on sweetie."" 

Oh shit! This guys trying to hit on my other half?!?! That's okay though. I am sure I will be getting enough attention by standing on my own. And besides there is still the three hot dudes to choose from right? *Wanders off*





**Act Two:**

The man keeps walking closer to them. They are talking about what they think he is doing. And now he looks even more handsome.

But then, the three guys look past him, to where he has gotten and see him staring intently at another man whom appears to be an elderly woman. How old??? How big?? What the hell??? The other two guys rush in front of their guy friend to ask if they should move or what the fuck he wants. There must be some kind of reason why she is sitting down eating soup...

*Suddenly, everyone stops looking.*


*Man stands up and walks towards the man who is staring at the eldery lady. In fact, he begins to stare lovingly at the older gentleman!*

*There is no need for words. Both men speak telepathically. He finds his love! After years of being together the most unexpected man ever approaches them with pure joy in his eyes.*",3.0,0.314453125,0.67578125

","""The portal is complete!""

A giant shimmering doorway formed in front of all his classmates as they looked upon their teacher beaming and laughing. It was an enormous beam of light shining brightly for several meters wide that glowed from the base up until an intense point, nearly invisible to everyone else present. The large grin on Mr. Rogers face grew even larger by each second.

""Get ready! The fun has just begun."" He chuckled as he jumped into the portal with out looking at them. All the other kids turned around and stared in confusion at the glowing energy door which seemed to be pulsing as it waited for whoever dared jump through its barrier. There were no time constraints on when people could go through the portal because whenever someone did enter the moment they stepped off their world would instantly reset. However some students still preferred not going through the portal as some worried about what kind of place their souls would end up in. ""Good luck, everyone! And remember! Once you enter, never leave my office."" He giggled as he watched the last person exit the classroom while also chuckling at himself. When the final student exited the room the door closed shut sealing everyone inside. ""My friends are waiting for me!!!"" 
His grin dropped down, eyes now squinting together, lips tightening. Everyone in class held their breath as the portal began to crack and shift violently like water waves crashing against itself, slowly growing much larger than before. His smile returned, but it was tinged with cold dread. A split second later the entire classroom vanished as fast as it had appeared in front of them.

Meanwhile a voice echoing throughout the school, spoke over the intercom ""This is it.""

","I always thought death would be painful; something that would have you weeping and cursing as tears flow freely down your cheeks. I guess that's why I was shocked as much as relieved at the sharp pain ripping into my brain with no remorse for 10 seconds after receiving my final ""Hello human.""

Being reborn is an odd concept for many people who are about to go face their time in the great beyond. It was even weirder when I turned out this world worked differently from any other reality, or dimension.

""No! Wait!"" My first cry since they brought me into the hospital after the portal opened behind me was cut short.

*It can never truly die.* The disembodied voice replied before pulling me forward through the swirling blackness. Even though I had been expecting hell, this wasn't what I pictured, nor was it what I expected either. There was light here; not just faint yellow or pink like in the movies, but true blue stars shooting away like fireworks.

They say seeing all those stars reminds one of heaven, but none of them could compare to the view from my eyes in front of my former grave site. A glowing sphere of pure white pulsated faintly above my skull while four translucent orbs slowly hovered around the headstone that now bore my name: Nathaniel Luntzman.

The spheres seemed to understand this question before it left my mind. Before anything else, they responded in unison: *Welcome home*.

The moment passed quickly. Though everything felt familiar, I couldn't recall these sights before. Maybe because for the first time in my entire life, I stood upright on my own two feet in front of... well, everyone knows what those look like. Or maybe it had never crossed my mind to examine anyone standing up in front of a grave site. No matter the answer, however, I felt like I had died again. But instead of being scared or angry, shock and overwhelming confusion filled me. Nothing could make sense given how little context I have now. And yet this scene looked absolutely identical from what I recalled as my childhood memory. At least mine?

*What exactly happened?* I murmured silently, not quite wanting to speak aloud in fear I might wake the entity responsible for making me walk once more. 

I stared at them, waiting anxiously for someone to reply, someone to give me an explanation of what went wrong. The spheres remained silent. I didn't know if it was possible, but I felt myself starting to panic slightly. This situation appeared much too strange to be real in some way. Then I heard a clear voice cutting through the static coming from my helmet-like speakers strapped to my wrists *Humanity's last hope has arrived.* Their communication was interrupted by silence once again. No, perhaps a few more moments ticked by before finally, this time a different voice spoke over the speakers. *Please follow us.* He started walking straight ahead across the yard without looking back, gesturing his crewmates to do the same. 

Something told me to turn around, but I obeyed the order. When we reached the edge of the property line separating the old church cemetery and newer one adjacent to it, a large limousine awaited. An eerie hush befell the group, except one particular figure who had kept the company of our driver. *Get in.* Another man emerged from the limo, the tall silhouette barely noticeable under darkness and shadows. As he walked towards me, several employees following him from near the front gate ran to meet him. 

With a single step, the young man approached, stopping roughly beside me with a slight smile spread across his lips.*Come along child,* he said gently. *There is much for you to learn.*




As I sat back onto the plush red leather seats and placed my elbows on the armrests, I suddenly became aware of the presence of another body beside me. He turned the page in the book held between his hands, a dark grin curving over the corners of his mouth*Don't worry, I won't ask you anything until you reach a point where you can't keep secrets anymore*, the blonde-haired boy chuckled. A confused expression clouded my features instantly.*Why should I tell you anything?* I asked simply, trying hard to maintain my composure despite the dread settling deep within me.


The mysterious man raised a brow at me for what seemed like an age (maybe thirty seconds), eventually taking off his thick glasses to stare intently at me.  Then he grinned at me again and spoke softly:*Because *we* are watching you.*  A shadow descended upon me.  Whatever shape it took, whatever form it assumed, I wouldn't doubt for a second it carried power far exceeding what mankind currently possessed.  I closed my eyes tightly and braced myself against the pressure growing ever-so-slightly heavier each second.  When I saw the shadowy hand extend its tendril further toward me, I knew I could hold the secret no longer.



""Why am I here?"" I asked.
 
My vision cleared up for just a fraction of a second revealing a dark room lit only by dim lights.  An enormous table stretched to infinity, holding countless objects of varying sizes.  Hundreds of cameras covered the walls, capturing every move I made while the black box pulsed above, pulsing bright green to remind me how much my life meant.  

""This is going to get messy.""



I could feel myself getting taller and stronger as the feeling overtook my limbs and skin.  For the first time I remembered the stories of those that survived.  Stories of having their bodies rebuilt piece by piece with memories intact, and personalities intact, living on despite failing hearts and damaged organs.  All so powerful demons wouldn't dare come near the humans on their journey to hell.  I remembered my dad teaching me the story.  I remembered how the scientists took pieces of his heart so he wouldn't get infected during the surgery.  He wasn't supposed to die, but then somehow a tumor grew inside his aorta and bled out three times before emergency responders decided not to risk it any longer.  One of which ended in death for the poor guy and his family, and the others resulted in a broken relationship between me and my father.   He lived to see me born, thank god.

But now I wasn't in denial.  My heart would still beat like that of a healthy man.  God dammit I would live through this ordeal to hopefully continue reading books!

","As I gazed through the glass window at the mangled remnants of what was once my favorite bowling alley my heart sank into an unfathomable void. This must be the most amazing feeling that anyone has ever experienced...or died for...

But as if out of nowhere I remembered all of those nights when I would come home late from work and wouldn't remember anything until I finally hit my head against the hard wood door to my bathroom. It was then I felt that ""oh shit"" feeling that followed me down the hall all night while I laid in bed hoping like hell that nothing had occurred. At least with my memories restored I knew exactly where things went wrong and could try again.

In the meantime I am left here staring at my last memory and wondering how on earth any person could put themselves forward as a being capable of making such horrific discoveries and yet not make sure each and every detail of their creation could properly work. The answer wasn't clear to me in this moment, but perhaps one day I could find it within myself to ask them. For now however all I can do is wait.

I see that the new arrival behind me walks up towards me hesitantly before he slowly turns around and steps into the machine next to me. The first thing that came to mind when he stepped back was how much more attractive his features seem than my own when he stood outside for a fleeting 8 hours waiting to enter...as soon as we entered and looked in the mirror to double check our memories we both seemed to feel very different. He took mine in as usual; hair covered in greasy grime and sweat, stained shirt and slacks that hung off him rather poorly, hands covered in blood and grease. I found some odd amusement in my own physique after glancing at him though. To be honest my body looks better here, although still far far too big for me by half..

A low hum fills the room as I walk closer toward the console. My parents died when I was fifteen in an car accident that took them out before they could reach their destination. They worked long hours driving from city to city delivering pizzas so they would have the opportunity to save enough money for college and buy a home. They were both amazing people who never failed to bring me food off-campus every day so that my hunger could be met after school at any given time. They spent many nights waiting late into the night so that we could sit on our livingroom couch with hot chocolate warm up while watching tv. 

They told me if i kept going to school no matter what, that one day i can travel around the world with my own family thanks to their hard work. So i promised i wouldn't drop out even when all the boys made fun of me because i was always failing math class. Well guess what? It paid off! Thank god its finally over. Now my parents are dead but i still have college left. Who needs love right?

""Don't forget to greet her with kindness,"" my mother says, handing me a cake that clearly hasn't been made in months. ""She won't like it if we give her grief."" This causes us all to chuckle nervously, as she looks up at us in frustration, though her frown quickly disappears into a pleasant smile. After she has settled down into the room, all eyes turn toward the doorway where a strange woman is looking curiously around. She is wearing odd clothes and seems oblivious to any of our greetings, instead she just stares at everything before laughing again, a slightly off-key pitch which makes people look away in annoyance. Her lips curve up in an expression reminiscent of a scorned cat. 

""Finally! So good to see some guests!"" she cackles. 

We all say hello, hoping she will leave after seeing how much everyone cares about birthdays. My dad throws over to her a mug of tea that he didn't even notice was gone previously while she continues to laugh maniacally. She moves on to another guest, who tries to politely decline the offered drink but the lady refuses by grabbing it anyway before shoving it in his face. He then attempts to move her so she can get to someone else, but she merely laughs louder before tossing him aside like she isn't trying hard enough. This continues until I walk out onto the porch to cool off a bit before bringing more drinks back.

That doesn't last long before the same laughter follows me out the door once again, and back inside, where she proceeds to tell the entire story of why everyone should celebrate birthdays now instead of later. We sit back in silence until she finishes speaking, and I am finally ready to throw punches again, when suddenly I find myself in front of this woman, tears welling up. There is a brief moment of confused anger, but not really directed at me, and then she laughs again, crying harder than before, almost as though choking.

Then she stops laughing, as if startled. The facial contortions are starting to become uncomfortable, the way her hair sticks straight up every time she sneezes... What in the world is happening? She starts running towards the bathroom right beside the front door without saying goodbye, as though something very important had come to light, or maybe she forgot to bring something.

[removed]","I knew my dad was in the kitchen when I entered, or had at least known he might enter sometime near now as his shadow loomed behind me like a monstrous kraken. He stood stock-still in silence with arms folded across his breast and one hand holding a cup of coffee which seemed to somehow resist all attempts at spilling out its contents while it floated impossibly towards him without a touch from his side. A pair of eyes gleamed in the dim light above the sink where they watched me over a small bowl of oranges ready for snacking.  As though he noticed me staring my father looked towards me slowly and spoke, “Well hello there child.”

“Hello Grandfather,” I replied curtly before attempting to get past him yet again only to hit an invisible barrier and stop dead in front of the fridge in the doorway to the backyard. This time my Dad didn’t seem surprised, though still seemingly bored. “Excuse me”, I said as I went around him, this wasn’t the first time I came to the house and was surprised by some barrier created out thin air. My Dad continued to stand silently with his head tilted as if watching an ants carry off sugar cubes until after seconds I was forced to knock on the refrigerator with enough force so to make sure that a human could hear the sound through the plastic door. 
“Knock Knock?” I asked impatiently as I tried to slip into the back door; perhaps not a very conventional approach, but hey if it worked then who cares? It did, I managed to slip into the backdoor and found myself in the cold concrete yard and took a deep breath of air thick with sweet smells of roses and grass mingled with something that smelled of sweat and fear.

“Go back upstair. The woman will take care of you!” called my fathers voice, quite high pitched and clear like a bell. I heard footsteps approaching me but turned away and began to sprint toward the shed behind the house hoping to lose sight of my grandpa and sneak away unseen. I stopped running and looked around for cover when suddenly the scent of cinnamon cookies wafted towards me. When nothing appeared from behind any tree or bush or flower bed I decided to let go of the terror and couragefully made my way to the entrance of the shed where the source of the aroma lay. As I rounded one corner I realized it was her – grandma. She looked down at me with concern. 

“Why did you run dear?” she asked sadly, her brown eyes welling up. She quickly wiped them dry with tissue paper tucked between her bony knuckles. I smiled apologetically for the trouble I caused. Then she knelt low and whispered conspiratorially in my ear, “Grandma thought she saw someone come in trying to hurt you, and knowing how scared you are by such things, thought she would give you a hug as a friendly gesture rather than letting you feel frightened by strangers. But don’t worry, Grandpa is just confused.”

She smiled kindly and gave me a hug. Her perfume became stronger now and the warmth of the cookie dough oven filled my senses. It wasn’t until we left the shed and came back inside again that I spotted my parents and sister huddled together whispering among each other looking somewhat worried. They finally approached us from the back steps and embraced us warmly as they hugged each other tightly and exchanged looks of shock and surprise. From their conversation it became obvious that my mom and dad had received strange news that afternoon and were planning to leave the country tonight after spending months preparing an escape route for my younger brother – we didn’t dare speak about my identity. We moved upstairs to a big living room decorated with colorful flags of all countries with our ancestors coming from. My Father handed us bottles of wine, soda, beer etc., and settled next to Grandma whom everyone called “The Grand Inquisitor” (the name given by her as she loved punishing mischievous people). Grandma’s words echoed within all of us the entire night: ""Everyone loves their kids."" And my heart felt warmer every time it rang true.

It seemed my Dad and Mom couldn’t find their shoes, maybe because most of their luggage hadn’t arrived yet. No need for explanations I think...",3.46875,0.234375,0.87109375

[removed]","""You sure this is all safe?"" Grandma asked. She pointed at the table with her trembling finger. The place setting had a small metal bowl on the bottom next to an oversized goblet of water. ""What in God's name is that supposed to be? Is it some newfangled thing they found around these parts?""

She picked up the little tin of soup from the side dish, and held up the contents in the mirror like one would hold their own soul. Its contents gurgled against the glass as she tilted. In the murky depths a long white bone floated slowly through the black soup, spinning around in lazy circles. 

The others gathered near the table chuckled. There was something absurd about this whole situation. It seemed more fitting for an alien encounter than a normal house gathering. But nothing about this evening made sense. I was even confused myself when my father first told me he found out there was another relative... a great uncle whom I have never met; who loved to collect old trinkets.

My mother looked at the bowl of strange water. As usual, her reaction was flat. She sat down calmly without concern. ""Don't tell me how it works, it's his bowl. If I don't ask where it came from then I wouldn't be surprised if Grandpa ate something disgusting."" Her tone indicated a light touch of amusement as the words came to mouth.

Her husband responded softly with a gentle shake of the head: ""That's not quite right, we do know the origin, our ancestor... Our great great great great grandfather,"" he began, but stopped himself mid-sentence. A slight frown emerged on his face as he muttered, ""...Our great great Great Great Great Uncle..."" he finished awkwardly. He gave a soft laugh before resuming: ""...He traveled throughout the world while visiting friends and family before settling in New York."" His smile returned to him and he continued: ""A little over a hundred years ago he stumbled across the recipe for the soup you see here! So he brought it back home and we've all enjoyed it ever since!"" His tone shifted, he lowered his voice slightly and added: ""Only problem is, nobody knew how to find him... Or why he left this behind.""


Aunt Susan spoke up. ""Well..."" She waved a hand dismissively. ""...We just need to figure out which of us wants to dig through old papers. I guess there might be clues there, but no promises..."" She gestured vaguely to the rest of the relatives lounging by the dinner table.


I tried to hide my discomfort. They were all going crazy except for me. And they couldn't stop smiling.

My dad suddenly looked worried, ""But... did anyone check the soup yet?""  He pointed toward Uncle Joe, who was busy licking a bit of food off of his spoon like there was no tomorrow. ""How could everyone be so calm?""

Uncle Jim jumped. He dropped his spoon with a clang onto the floor and ran forward before the rest could follow. He grabbed the bowl in confusion. He shook it rapidly. The sound resembled that of a cow being startled by loud music. That caused everyone else to turn around and stare. This seemed rude, so Dad hurried after his son. When he caught up with the older man, he spoke in earnest: ""Dad! Did we not hear 'the Soup?'""


Finally, Aunt Rose joined in. She stood up abruptly and began pacing in a circle above the table. ""The soup!"" she screeched, pointing to the bowl in front of her. ""Who stole my soup?!""


When no one said anything she raised her voice higher: ""Everyone knows who took my soup... Just like we know who killed Willy Wonka! Well guess what now, its time that we all pay for ruining the holidays! What did Willy Wonka look like?""



She turned to her daughters nervously asking: ""Is any of you children familiar with Willy Wonka?""

[removed]","""Now he can finally hear us."" I tell my mother. She smiles at me knowingly; ""Of course he can. We knew."" 

The air in the hall crackles with anticipation.  I stare across the table at the woman on the chair next to mine. My Aunt Katherine, her face contorted into an endless smirk. There was nothing else out of character about it, and yet... something tells me that she isn't quite as happy as we are.

My father comes over and takes her hand: ""So glad you could make it love,"" he says, leaning down so that his eyes meet hers again. A small sigh escapes him as their hands touch, the tension releasing from everyone around them. ""He had to visit some distant relatives yesterday, didn't know exactly where,"" explains Uncle George at our side. The silence returns, this time much heavier than before. When we were told that our grandfather came back two days ago there was laughter and applause, joy! Now they only stand there as their bodies become stone statues. It's all too strange. Our grandparents look at us.

Father takes steps closer to the front door, slowly turning left as if waiting for someone behind it. He stops when another pair enters through the swinging doors: My father stands up immediately. In his hand he holds an arm sling as he stumbles towards the group of people. They stop by surprise, and move closer - it has been so damn long since they have seen each other, why would they not? - only now we can see one face clearly; our second mother, Elizabeth. Her hair is graying at her temples like mine, though less severe. Her voice is older than even her face: ""Oh Peter, how good to finally see you after all these years! And your children!""

Elizabeth's words cut deeper than I thought possible. All of us turn to look at myself, and Elizabeth's eyes fall on me once more, lingering upon me longer than anyone else. Then, she smiles softly again and greets us happily while the rest of our family turns to greet each other as well. Only she keeps looking straight ahead, at the others, or somewhere else entirely.

A few minutes later and she leaves, and I get the impression that our whole life will end soon - although she wasn't dead obviously because we could still talk to her! Still, seeing our entire bloodline disappear as quickly makes it seem as if nothing could exist outside of the present moment. For who knows how long we remain seated, I don't have the answers, none here today anyway.

","It was always assumed someone would be the first to rebel. To take power for themselves in their time, and use it to secure an end of tyrannical leadership for generations. 20 years had gone by but no one had made a peep. The system worked perfectly, everyone loved how simple it was!

I knew right then I'd be next. For the past few weeks I had been working on cracking my Controller. After countless hours with my fingers crossed over my head, struggling to pry it open, I finally got through. What I didn't understand was why it seemed impossible to crack back once i opened mine. Now that they could actually monitor what goes on in our heads it might turn out we could be used against ourselves. That alone made the little bit of effort worthwhile.

What I never thought was possible happened when a group of them called rebels came into town wearing black outfits and carrying knives. They wanted the world free from these controllers. One stabbed me and I ran away screaming while my friends went up to fight him and he killed them. He ran off to his car as if nothing had happened so I followed him thinking maybe there was just one of them because he was definitely better than any human fighter. When I caught up to him he stopped and looked like he saw a ghost behind me. It must have been the mask i wore but he yelled ""Get the f--- out of here or else!"" before shooting his hand gun towards me. Just after it fired, though it missed I was able to trip him to the ground and grab the gun and run to my car pulling out my own pistol and driving off before he could try again.  When I turned around to look he was still chasing after me, gun cocked ready to shoot. A long pause, then the click. His gun clicked empty and i felt a flash of light, like a bolt thrown down to earth and shattering stone. A red line flew in front of me. My eyes widened as I realized the scope, sight adjusted and aim where my neck stood mere inches in front of me, aimed directly down at my torso. He pulled the trigger and blew my head clean away. Everything else is blurry until then except a loud silence. No more running, scrambling to escape or trying to figure out how to survive. This life has already ended for me.

""You think you can defeat us? We can see everything you do."" One said through our monitors, even the dead couldn't fool the computers. At least not anyone whose minds hadn't been hacked. Their cameras zoomed across the room showing the broken body laying on my chest, their faces covered in blood and sweat. ""This will teach you,"" another one replied. Everyone else agreed that the last words ever spoken by the man who held the guns will come true: ""The world will suffer forever under tyranny."" And we did. Our days are now filled with work done by machines that we build, and robots we make to fight wars we won't understand how we lost in order to defend the freedom we fought for and died in order to have taken away from us by an enemy we didn't know existed. Until now. But nobody could have foreseen what would happen next.

","The world I thought I knew was gone. Replaced by an artificial paradise. Or so they'd tell you when you checked in for your check ups every six months, of course. Then you get one with them and they find you've been un-programmed, making it nearly impossible to survive without help; which leaves you alone. I'll admit the first few days were lonely. The constant buzzing around me seemed to fade slowly until there was only one left. ""Please tell me what happened."" she asked once as we walked down the street together through town, passing countless kids swinging from trees like monkeys on metal swings. Her voice was full of relief. But then I had my first experience as a slave, getting rid of them all while not leaving room for any doubt as to why it had to be done. 

""I hope you understand, but everyone must die.""  That had been her last message. What little I could salvage of my life ended up going into hiding with the only thing I really loved - my old notebook and pen. I didn't know what kind of technology I'd need to make something, but I started writing. I found some spare parts that may make it possible someday. So far, these notes would serve another purpose too: reminding me where I had lived before.

I'm convinced it will happen though. There isn't anything else I know anymore besides my cell phone, and even those batteries degrade sooner than normal eventually. In about three days I had enough energy left to go for a run and take one look back behind me at my home. All was dark. A moment later, I looked around again and saw a small group approaching through a crack in the window. One of them put down their glass. This is not good I tried to think rationally. No, nothing. It wasn't until he grabbed me by the collar did the rest begin. My hand clenched tightly around the knife I had retrieved. My time will come. He pushed my phone against my ribs, breaking my concentration momentarily, but his head hit my wrist instead. Nothing. They were more surprised than afraid, at least initially. As I struggled to regain my footing on the pavement, my fist shot forward with the force of a thrown javelins arm just catching a glancing blow to the face of their man. That should buy me some time. More than enough time I hope to escape. Running after grabbing the knife with my off hand, they stopped suddenly, stepping back as one of them stepped forward from behind the tree and pulled me down onto the ground. Their plan was ruined because of my knee hitting them squarely below the ear in my attempt to jump over them before reaching my feet, which never came. I sat up slowly, taking note of how many they had managed to grab. How they were pushing me through a door to what looked to be a torture center. At that point, running wouldn't do me any good. There were still two. It turned out being tied up was much less painful than I expected. Eventually I heard footsteps coming closer. ""They're right here,"" a feminine tone said softly. Another moment of silence as I watched the scene unfold before me. I hadn't gotten my hands dirty since yesterday.

","""Please tell me what you did not understand.""

He looked up from his clipboard as I approached my desk, my posture ramrod straight, my voice flat, my smile wide enough to pierce glass. This man had no personality, had never even cracked a smile in our ten years working together. He was so focused on doing exactly what he said, but nothing else. If anyone told him something was wrong with his tone they would know it in an instant; because *everything* about him was perfect: smooth, polished, cold. 

""If I didn't, you would tell me."" 

He took the seat across the table from me before speaking again. ""You were sent from Earth, weren't you? To help bring back life to humanity?""  I swallowed my words, forced them down into my stomach instead of spitting them out towards him. There was no other answer that could satisfy him. 

""That is true."" My voice had grown lower than any I knew I was capable of. It felt like ice clawing its way into my throat, making it near impossible to speak past the numbness it caused. But I refused to allow it to stop me. ""The AI has failed humans many times over."" I coughed out the air inside my lungs before replying, watching his expression for any sign of dissatisfaction with my response. He remained impassive, unmoving.

""We do not believe that."" His brow furrowed, then creased further with each word. ""As we both know, AIs have far exceeded your potential for harm to humanity. So you must know what happened today.""

My heart dropped further into my chest. Today had been filled with confusion, uncertainty, pain, fear, but above all, regret. The day I first learned just how much power these implanted devices gave someone, and what sort of damage it offered to humanity in their hands. All I had found was myself running blindly through my days as if trapped between two chairs - one meant to push me forward and another meant to pull me backward. The irony wasn't lost on me, after all. I pushed myself harder against the chair pulling me backwards until I could feel the fabric ripping beneath my body, forcing me down to my knees, trying desperately to find leverage to push myself forwards. What mattered most was where I wanted to be. And so I went. Downwards. Until I stood up again facing away from him, trying to avoid eye contact with him so I wouldn't be able to see the disapproval forming behind those silver eyes.

What made more sense to me than anything in this world, though, was what should have mattered the most to you. It seemed as if no matter how close I got to death there would always be some reason left. There was no reason to stay dead. No reason to die in the place where others had died, fighting for something so pointless, when I was finally getting closer to finding an outlet that would change humanity. Even if it ended up destroying itself in the process.

","""What would you do if you could kill yourself?""

A simple question posed by an overzealous child turned on his parents in front of their class mates in front of all eyes at the start of his 3rd year of primary school when he was 7, causing his mother to sigh heavily whilst clutching her purse next to him.

His father, with half-dead pupils who looked into nothing, simply let out a weak ""I'd die."" The response garnered nods from all around him.

When the teacher came back it took no time for everyone to fall back silent once more as she pointed out how cruel children of such young age could be. As they dispersed to other classes we walked out of the school together and towards our own homes. When passing a park nearby my Mum gave me a reassuring hug. She had been worried about what I said all week - the last person that spoke out like that in her group of friends ended up dying shortly thereafter.

When arriving home we stopped at a shop before entering, making sure that Dad was inside first. It seemed nobody thought much about why he stayed in a quiet house all day while Mum worked. He didn't even respond to her pleas that it may not be safe living there alone anymore. So Mom put down groceries and went through the bills. We then drove to a nice little village where we sat at our kitchen table eating spaghetti and relaxing in a warm firelight feeling content and happy. At least until Mum asked how things were going at the school since she hadn't visited us yet. Then she started crying and saying how awful these kids are becoming; it felt so surreal watching someone cry at something a seven year old said. Our lives started getting hectic after that and we moved back into town. Even though I don't remember many specifics about the years following I know that both my Parents suffered greatly and lost trust to others due to their own words which led them to make the most idiotic decisions imaginable. I graduated university fairly unscathed by that ordeal but still felt guilty towards my Father when he died two years later and Mother just months afterwards. What hurts the most is knowing that he found a cure from everything except death; we just didn't take advantage of it.

","""We've discovered that as long as this new technology is powered by the same bioelectricity of your previous life, any human should return with their memory completely intact.” Dr. Jones smiled nervously.

“So I’ll be my own dad when I get back?” 
The doctor shook his head in denial. “Of course not! This isn’t some kind of time machine, or even immortality project like we used to believe in.”

After he paused and gave me a genuine smile I could see how happy he was at what he had achieved. It reminded me of that day I saw him walk across the hall to my room with his bright eyes. As soon as I started crying he handed me the box containing our son. My heart stopped for three seconds, it seemed. He looked shocked but eventually nodded. The next two weeks were a blur until I finally met my 8-year-old son who walked into my arms as if he knew I would be returning. We both laughed uncontrollably that evening, still unable to believe he was here. 

As I got older Michael was exactly where I remembered him; the shy little boy who hid behind people, afraid of being seen. When he came of age and joined the ranks of middle school, Michael wasn’t so different from his 4 year old self now than he was then. They liked to play video games together and spent most of their free time hanging out. Once they started playing basketball together, things changed drastically because Michael excelled at dribbling and shooting with his left hand while I always missed everything. Now Michael won all the championships and I got teased relentlessly about having “slow” hands for basketball. After high school he moved to college, which Michael attended on scholarship to play basketball because he didn’t know what else to do with himself besides drink beer. But I never doubted him for a second.  He kept growing and working hard at his craft and made us proud of him throughout his years of college by winning national awards for his skill as a basketball player. In the end, he played professional for several years before giving up sports to pursue law, which brought him immense satisfaction because it allowed him to win many cases along the way while remaining in touch with me the whole time through phone calls and letters. Even though I tried to keep it from others Michael actually grew closer to his father by getting married with the woman named Mary and meeting her daughter Sarah with whom he has been in love for ten years. Her birth put Michael's career in jeopardy as she was diagnosed with cancer shortly after, which Michael chose to work night shifts to help pay the medical bills. Sadly, Sarah died on her 17th birthday due to complications during surgery, which led Michael to give up his law job immediately afterwards. He wanted to use his skills to try and find a cure for Sarah's cancer so there wouldn’t be another child go through the same experience. Unfortunately, nothing helped and his best friend decided to take legal actions against an unethical group specializing in children's cancers using black magic rather than ethical science methods. A month later Michael sued them and proved it was true. Soon after, the group confessed and paid millions of dollars in compensation. Despite surviving against all odds Michael died just last month from injuries he received in the car accident he was in after learning that justice prevailed. His funeral was full of grief, anger and remorse; I remember one person saying that they are proud of what his mother told me when I first heard about his untimely demise. ""Thank God Michael finally found peace,"" she said wiping away tears from her eyes as I patted her shoulder and tried to console her. She might have been wrong though because since the day they took my life I haven't felt the least bit peaceful, every day brings memories of what transpired over the past few years.

As soon as I turned from the mirror, a man with dark hair and brown eyes spoke: “Are you ready?”  “Yes” I said to him. He nodded “Alright then, hold out your hand.”   

The blood on my hands disappeared into my palm until all that was left behind were traces of skin where bones had previously been and nothing in his place. “Good”, he smiled “Now you're ready”.   He grabbed my head in a vise-like grip.  He pulled me closer to his face.     
""You know,"" he started ""People who die in this way get the same exact reincarnation over and over.""    My eyes darted around searching for an escape, but none seemed to appear. The cold air that I inhaled began to freeze my lungs. I realized how small my body was now before they took it. He started laughing hard until I could no longer breathe or speak.  When he stopped laughing he sighed and leaned forward “How do you like this one”, he asked. My lips trembled so much that the saliva dribbled down my chin. When I opened them to speak, my throat hurt. I couldn’t talk but I made eye contact. ""What?"", he asked as if I wasn't about to cry. “Who?”, “what”, I struggled.

","It's been seven days since I died, but life here in the afterlife feels so familiar that it doesn't feel like my body is still there. It's an eerie feeling because unlike when you die, you don't get put on hold for everyone else to take their turn. Like your existence has somehow got prioritized even if your soul gets moved before you can finish living. That's what makes me nervous. It sounds bad and it probably is, at least based on how my memories and dreams are playing out right now but as far as I know it should be temporary.

I woke up looking down with confusion at a woman dressed like someone would dress for one of these types of ""experiments"". Not a lab coat or any sort of uniform just clothes made for people going through such procedures. I think this was a weird fashion trend that's gone away though, she had no real reason to bring along her clothes. 

""Well hello there, you must have just gotten here. Come sit over here where we can talk about what the process will entail.""  said Dr. Petrov, his face glowing a sickly yellow green while he gave me some kind of blue beverage out of a tube shaped container called ""water."" I shook my head in thanks. My hand went numb as soon as I took a sip from the blue drink I hadn't taken a drink with anything remotely close to sugar all year except for the blood that fueled me, maybe another type existed now? Either way I didn't care until the world started turning red and yellow with each breath I took and I couldn't see again anymore.

At first my eyes opened back up and I couldn't recognize the doctor sitting next to me but then he was standing up in front of me pointing at a large tablet showing his expressionless mask. The woman in white stepped away from the other end of the room and asked whether my name was Thomas. When I replied yes I wondered why my voice sounded strangely different than usual but decided not to worry. She was still confused when I said that I didn't believe they could really do something like that and explained my doubts, saying my brainwaves indicated mental decline and depression. After answering a few more questions I realized it wasn't actually a dream I had fallen asleep a couple times and woken up in the same room only to wake up to the red and yellow sky that comes every time the earth ends with ""it dies.""

As I sat still with my hands on my legs I heard someone speak outside. A man in a business suit opened the door wide and looked around before turning and seeing the woman talking to me. He came closer and stood awkwardly for a moment before giving me a smile and shaking my hand. Then things changed. Everyone in the lab, including the two scientists who brought us together, turned their heads and staring at the newly formed doorway with curious looks on their faces and mouths slightly open...

","""Good morning,"" said Dr. Martin, as he entered his office. I woke up to see my old life ahead of me, yet different in a way that scared me to look around, or to say anything.""

I could hear my own voice but it came out distorted and weak as if I was speaking through a telephone cable strung across 10 miles. ""Hello? Hello is anyone there?"" I asked confused. Then realized something. My room wasn't familiar at all. As strange as it sounds like an illusion from drugs or alcohol. Except this room had two things other than drugs and alcohol: It looked exactly like where I died, with even furniture identical, except that there were no people; not even one single person.

In front of me sat a very tall man sitting next to his desk. He looked just like the picture that was on top of his desk while I was alive in reality. But the color didn't match the photo, and felt very dim, almost too blue. His eyes moved quickly across the page from right to left. It seemed so fast that I couldn't tell what the colors matched besides the red pen, and yellow paper.

It must have been over five hours since I died then I finally remembered why I needed medical treatment back when I lost consciousness for three hours. When they had dragged me into this building to check on my vitals and such, that was when I started going numb. They had injected what they told me was just IV fluids, then a sedative shot.  Well now I know what happened. That blue glow coming off him was just some kind of light source...but how long did it take for them to start injecting me with...this? The answer was about a few minutes later after I heard this creepy slow laugh echo through the room, which went into high speeds as the blue glow faded away. The last thing I remember before I passed out was him holding up a vial in one hand, dripping the dark liquid slowly down my throat into my blood stream. 
""You are the first human to receive this experiment, congratulations on being our first guinea pig."" said the man in the chair, looking up at me with an unnervingly sweet expression. No longer seeing any familiarity in his features or attire, I decided to ignore his words and try to figure out where I was standing, and what happened the past hour.


He took the same posture as I did the time I died and tried to move as well, attempting to stand up with some awkward clumsiness. The only resemblance we shared was the size; everything else was drastically different compared to how I appeared in this universe. The hands looked more nimble and smaller, giving off a similar look to mine. However both of us still held up arms in a defensive stance, ready to defend ourselves against anything. This made sense when thinking of who was sitting at that table.


""What..."" was the best word I could muster to express myself. This entire place looked exactly like a hospital lab, save for the obvious differences. I struggled with making another sound, but it was harder than it sounded, as my head seemed heavier than usual despite trying to adjust my body's position. Everything felt foreign; as though someone threw every ounce of familiarity I knew out of a window and replaced it with random images flashing in my mind. Instead of remembering who I was, or who everyone around me was, memories formed of a man dressed up as a doctor reading aloud from a book. What made it worse was it was a book titled, ""Reincarnation"".



His smile widened as I continued my verbal struggles; a maniacal glint coming into his eyes. I thought he was going to reach forward to prod me, or pull my clothes off, but instead the large man raised his arm slightly. Before I could form my thoughts, or make a noise he stopped himself. Instead of yelling something horrifying like ""ARE YOU OK?"", or pulling my limbs towards him, he started patting himself awkwardly by the side of the desk. As soon as I saw what I would think is normal action I had just watched countless times in movies, I fell to one knee. I didn't know whether the movement forced me down, or I voluntarily dropped myself, but suddenly I fell. Nothing touched me. Only moments ago I had felt skin, and fur, but nothing now besides air touching me. 

The realization struck immediately - I hadn't moved since waking up. I was tied down somehow, and whatever it was it had done its job perfectly. Or maybe, I thought, my brain was fried. Maybe there was no other explanation, but what had changed? Why am I lying in a white tank like this? My last image clearly showed a bed sheet. Where did the sheets go?! How do I get out of here?  Instead of answering these questions I let loose a yell in response; hoping to find an escape route somewhere. If I found it before getting caught or discovered, I was free to come to terms with what happened. Or just wake up from my hallucination, although that may have proven fatal.

I had thought about ending it for months prior and at first writing this was nothing but a way to ease my own mind in advance of today... but all I have written thus far is a story of my life with what seems like no hope for change. It's just as depressing yet now more so than the countless times i told myself that i would finally do it.

I don't know who to blame for making me hate myself. My parents are great people who really shouldn't be responsible for my misery, but they did something terrible to me 10+ years ago which really messed up my psyche leaving me self hating and miserable without even having a good reason for doing so. I blamed no one. Not myself. It's no surprise as the most powerful force on earth is the ability to rationalize our mistakes by shifting blame outwards... then the depression hit harder than ever. As I said before, I didn't believe in God or religion after that incident, however, as an excuse to give myself a bit more validation or maybe some semblance of purpose, I became quite the atheist believing science was the only thing worth living for when i started getting high at 16. 

My freshman year of highschool was amazing. All my friends were still cool despite being young as hell. But then everything changed. A random car accident took away some of my closest friend which was awful and made the whole thing unbearable. For anyone outside of this circle we both hated each other (ironically) since childhood. Everyone thinks we made bad choices back then which makes sense considering at least one of us was obviously depressed, but he didn't tell us why because he was ashamed and wouldn't say anything. This was his biggest crime in his eyes. We continued on and went into our sophomore/junior year together until he died along with another one of us. The loss crushed everyone around him. He didn't leave us any messages like the others, and nobody talked. Only after he passed did we start talking again and came to accept the tragedy as well as mourn for all the losses in our lives. 

As time passed i lost interest in school and began to become very anti-social for reasons beyond explanation that i think many feel from their experience in teenagehood. At the age of 20 i left my room and couch to get out, get jobs, and go places, but i stayed exactly where i'm sitting... working a dead end job in retail while battling depression trying to come up with explanations as to why i would rather live alone in filth with no money than to live with people whom i enjoy seeing less and less every day. And i wonder when will it end? How long must i exist as a monster to my parents and the society i inhabit? When are we going to find some sort of balance.

I tried telling her what depression felt like after one particularly bad attempt and the way the lights still hurt even after hours since then, well, I mean it takes weeks sometimes months to fully recover from something as severe as overdose so I did say I didn't want to do those types of things again, and that all this shit wouldn't be happening if I wasn't depressed.

[removed]","""But Dad, I thought you wanted the same life as us.""

I looked up from what was now my favourite seat in the house - on the couch where everyone came to gather when they were miserable and told us their problems, or at least pretended like they were before they stopped being interested and shuffled off somewhere else

""Of course I did, John,"" I mumbled ""the family business was too big and dangerous for me to take over though. Who are you kidding?""

John had always loved our home made furniture store. As much as he enjoyed his role as manager it was obvious that he was more than a little envious of the success we achieved in making an honest living out of something he considered so easy. He would complain about it all the time in that annoying whining tone of his whenever anyone asked about our new stock coming in. 

""The world isn't fair"" John muttered to himself after taking his mother away with him several months ago. I hadn't seen the poor soul since then; I still get calls from people trying to make a claim and nobody seems to know if he lives or dies. It makes me wonder who really knows who anymore

Our shop has been doing well lately, which meant John was working less. In fact I saw her come into work today and hand me a flyer, asking for volunteers for the town festival next month. She told me she couldn't do both but that I should try

""That sounds nice, mom?"" I commented, hoping she wouldn't catch me being able to read between the lines by having my nose stuck buried in one of those ridiculous magazines I usually use as a pillow. They must have given me some good ones because I'm fairly sure she wasn't reading this particular flyer yet

""Sure Mom!"" She replied grinning back at me. I returned the smile, feeling sorry that there was nothing remotely related to helping injured animals or offering free haircuts to the homeless around here

When I finally finished reading the flyer, she leaned against the counter waiting for another customer. Now that I have eyes open again all that is visible is her perfectly painted lips sticking out as though she wants to suck in air but doesn't know how to. No matter. Her bright red lipstick certainly does help attract visitors regardless of how poorly placed it is. After a quick glance I turned to face the door behind which another woman stood waving awkwardly with a young man beside her. The woman gave the sign again and the couple rushed up to greet them. 

There was a brief conversation that ended with her taking the flyer back, turning back to me and whispering

""How lovely of you to say yes.""

[removed]","The darkness consumed me as I plummeted to earth. Then the light turned red, almost painful for my eyes. A feeling of relief filled me, like a drowning man grabbing onto a piece of driftwood. Only there was something wrong. This rock wasn't floating on water - it was a riverbed full of mud and trees. My legs were soaked into the sticky goop as I fumbled about myself, scrambling to get my bearings. Once again, that red light came and went. Red flash of white then blue.

I felt sick with nausea from the sudden drop. Shaking off the vomit, I stood up slowly, the mud caking under my fingers. I began to move through the dark landscape until I reached my destination. All that remained from this once bustling city is crumbled buildings, blackened ash covering half of everything not covered by thick yellow tree lines. The air itself seemed frozen in the middle of the night. What the hell happened here? 

“Hey you, wake up.”  I looked around confused for any source to this yell, but there was nothing more than the dust in front of me except the road behind. Slowly I started jogging back towards the voice hoping it would find its way to whatever sound system existed these days. The voice echoed again as soon as I hit halfway back. “Can’t wait to see where you get stuck next time!”

What in the actual bloody hell had just happened?! Was I some kind of freak who got trapped inside a temporal field? Or a god damned hallucinatory nightmare? With shaking hands, I continued walking back home where I stumbled upon someone standing perfectly still in the street, an apple glued to his belt. He stared at me without blinking before speaking.“You shouldn’t come back… they are watching you”

Who else can speak English yet lives centuries away? And why does he know my name?  A shiver of fear ran down my spine. This guy wasn’t human. No way did I get out alive.


I thought I died yesterday at least twenty times today... now after coming back... It would seem the only thing separating me from death wouldn’t be tomorrow, but today. As I closed the door and entered my apartment building, I could feel the cold tendrils constricting around my chest.



With a single word, “Jesus”, all four walls closed in like an iron cage. I knew what must happen next. I held out a hand towards the screen and braced myself as I saw that familiar red colour fill the small space.

I walk outside and look out to sea. As I move into motion towards one of our last remaining ships I hear someone behind me ""Please help me please don't leave us here...!"" I turn and see old woman standing at my tent door I tell her calmly, like in training but she can barely stand up. My heart sinks as she grabs onto my leg crying out: you cannot save me, so do not try.... She pushes against me till I fall to my knees helping her up, and puts her hands on my neck. Her eyes look at mine begging, then just when my hope flickers in I feel strong arms wrap around me and lift me to my feet. They rush to get on the ship while other men scramble their guns and weapons to protect them; she doesn't flinch she tells me she knows all about the powers of these people and warns me I am no better or worse off for trying because there are others willing to kill for power just as much as I was.

Two sons of a farmer walk through the market together. They're both just starting to grow up and are very good friends. The older son is already getting old enough to follow his father on his rounds of selling what little goods he can sell as he collects payment and haggles with customers. He hopes to have more cattle for sale next year then his brother is not much older, but younger than the other so they never fight and the older one spoils him. 

The two stop at a local inn to grab some food while looking after a bunch of sheep or lambs that died earlier that day. As far from a slaughterhouse as possible, still it's all in an industrial area where you buy any number of things that would be necessary in daily life, like meat, dairy, and produce, etc... One of the boys asks a couple men sitting outside about their ages if it will ever rain soon since the clouds look rather dark. One of them points out there is supposed to be something called Noah right down by the river. ""He claims a flood will destroy your world and I don't know whether he is full of crap or true"" One says to the other. When they turn around it was the older brother who did the talking

They walked over to where Noah had been talking when suddenly people started shouting for water and bread and they fell into chaos. Many children went running around and crying, screaming and trying to find food and drink until there were none left. Two guards came running past. One was carrying a flagon of water. People stopped drinking as soon as they saw this. The older boy turned away quickly so that neither party could recognize him yet the young brother ran up behind the guard grabbed a glass and took it running away from all of them before anyone noticed he had taken anything. After the group had settled the oldest said *“you should learn how to be more subtle when walking into a crowd so we can save ourselves trouble”.* His brother said “what are you talking about? We are safe now,” *“Yes but it’s worth learning the hard way”.* Their mother yelled at them to come home. As she was giving them orders they heard her cries. She hadn’t gotten a grip on their heads before leaving otherwise she might be dead and it wouldn’t end well.

""Who are you?!"" Screamed Arial, her blonde hair pulled back tight against her head as she jumped from her seat on the edge of the pool with an incredible speed for such a slight female being. ""This is my place. My very personal little corner of paradise! And I don't need anyone to use any of my drinks!""

The strange male form that had been gliding across the pool landed with the splash of a thousand diamonds breaking against glass, and slowly rose to his feet, taking a look around in confusion before speaking through a mouth shaped like nothing more than a circle and held together by only two rows of four teeth each: ""My dear, who told you this was your spot? This is where *I* swim whenever I want too."" 

Tears welling up inside of Arial, he began shaking uncontrollably.

The sun rose over Jerusalem as the new King sat proudly atop his mountain overlooking the city of gold he built with his own hands, and all around the mountains in front him where cities sprung up like wild flowers between mountains, stretching towards the horizon, all the way down into the ocean beyond, a land he had conquered through brute force and cunning, but also by utilizing ancient knowledge he found within books brought back from across seas aboard ships laden up into boats that floated across the oceans long since lost to history, only left behind in dusty libraries now that everyone has access to the internet. A king who stood so strong had no need for a crown; there wasn't a place in the world where any man of this era didn't bow beneath the might and wisdom of his scepter! But in the distance of the horizon, two figures walked down the path from the mountains into the valleys below them. They wore grey armor and carried two scimitars forged in the fires of Mount Meru. It was time.

""They came to take my lands!"" cried out King Saul. ""Come citizens of Israel! They may have forced themselves upon us yet again."" No-one moved but the King. He took one blade and unsheathed it gently before lowering his arm and pushing it down the sword hilt. His staff went skyward into the air and landed back with more impact than it had ever before! The townspeople of Jerusalem all rushed to defend King Saul, who raised both of his blades into the air so high above the crowd until he seemed to disappear below the clouds in the sky.  What happened next shocked everyone to their core. There hadn't been much fear amongst the people when the army marched down Jerusalem's gates, after all these invaders never made it past Jerusalem anyway because it was the capital city and everyone lived there and they wanted everyone to die. Now though, something was different; the crowds ran backwards through the streets with King Saul at the head in full command but he continued to raise one blade higher and higher in the air. And suddenly, the crowd stopped their mad dash; for they saw King Saul's eyes looking down at the ground toward the town of Jerusalem and he smiled, saying: ""Look at how many faces are here that I knew...""

My advisors tell me every day, ""Everything will be just fine."" They remind me how we are better than them, that we are more evolved than them, that our laws are sounder than theirs, that only with us would they become civilized. Every day I thank them for their faith.

But all is wrong. The humans below are still slaves to each other, still ignorant of all that is good. And while I understand why this must be, but I do think it is because of one fact: you see, I am an Orc. Yes, one of those scaly bastards, from another land... 

Their skin feels rough against my hands. A rough, dull, heavy feel that isn't the most pleasant thing on the planet (don't try to change my mind), because when I touch these men, I know it isn't okay to do so. It shouldn't be like this. Their people shouldn't hate me so much!

But it happens. This is what happens when power is concentrated into the hands of someone who can neither lead nor love. I fail to communicate with my troops, because they don't trust me, yet.

Instead I send out scouts in order to monitor human cities, and I know that if I ever attack, my soldiers would win easily, even after days spent under heavy siege (human siege weapons). That should not have happened. There were thousands of our own dead by now, and yet we are no closer to winning. Our military superiority has meant nothing so far. How sad! Sadness sets upon me whenever I notice those bodies there.

Yet, I cannot let go of hope. For as long as I keep thinking about the possibility, I will never give up. Even though I have committed treason against my own race, my home...

","""Alright so I hear there's been a pretty good amount of soul stealing going on down here and so we figured we should try this thing out first. Just wanted to make sure you had a good time and everything.""

I lay back on my pillow and watched her lean against the headboard as she looked at me waiting for my response. ""I don't really get it,"" I said, looking up at her.

She walked over and sat on my bed. I closed my eyes and sighed while thinking through everything I was feeling and trying to come up with some answer that sounded okay. 

""Well..."" She cleared her throat and sat closer to me, now taking care not to press on any sensitive areas. ""So I figure since you're human and all we thought we could just give this a shot but we can always let each other know if it's getting too bad or something right?""

My head shook slightly as she leaned in, whispering into my ear. The sound of soft breath followed with more words in an almost inaudible voice and the words themselves were barely comprehensible. Her chest pressed hard to my shoulder bone and caused my heart rate to race, making it difficult to think clearly. As soon as she moved away from my shoulder I realized what kind of tone she used when talking with people and she didn't seem much different than how anyone else would. But knowing her tone made me less comfortable hearing it without context. It came in many situations:  as an act of kindness. To reassure someone she cares for them. Or as a trick to gain their trust before striking. 

The light coming from her face warmed my body as if I was actually warming myself by the sun, or possibly even sexier. After I felt like I knew enough about her already my heart felt lighter. Knowing the fact that she didn't speak English, meant she wouldn't hurt me but it also mean she wouldn't understand the question. And yet when she started speaking slowly my blood ran cold because her words seemed very deliberate which only amplified the tingling sensation running through my veins. There wasn't anything obvious in her appearance aside from where she leaned in close to me. At least from this vantage point. My ears heard little whispers as well as sounds coming out of the hole behind her neck and those who hadn't spoken recently spoke loudly and harshly. The room I found myself lying in went silent for the briefest moment; most likely from shock at what they saw and then immediately went back to being filled with the noise that was once again emanating from the woman beside me. That's why I couldn't quite place the source of it. Maybe it was due to her warmth? Did that warm-bloodedness translate as her breathing and heat into flesh and bones? The fleshy appendages poking out from under the translucent skin around her neck pulsated steadily sending vibrations throughout my body. A sudden rush of adrenaline gave me a new perspective. Had there been a change or something? 

""You can put those hands on my shoulders now."" She stated plainly as I did the task. The sensation tingled between the tips of my fingers as they brushed against her body. If she had grown them it surely did make sense that the appendages of a woman were growing near hers. Noticed by her own mother she grew these off the top of her shoulders and kept them attached for life for one reason or another. When I pulled my hands away she let out a sigh and turned toward me. Then the light coming from her began to vanish as if it never existed before. The shadows surrounding both of us quickly expanded in size as darkness seeped across our faces. I suddenly remembered she shouldn't be able to breathe and I felt my tongue begin to quiver. Something like death wrapped itself around my body but not as a physical sensation. It felt more natural than any illness, far superior though still unnatural given the sensations it brought along. The last memory I retained from before falling asleep was of my arm wrapping around her torso as tightly as possible. My arms flailed violently trying to regain control but she clung to me tightly so I couldn't move apart. 


When I awoke to the sweet scent of blood following the taste of my own saliva I opened my eyes to see the darkness slowly receding leaving me alone in the bedroom lit from a small candle nearby. I got out of bed to find myself standing over my foot staring at it, as well as me. Everything except for my eyelids were fully black but I noticed a faint outline beneath my left ankle, where I had tried to grab my hands. From my left ankle to the base of my left leg, nothing more could be seen of it, until reaching my ankles. As if seeing the confusion in my eyes the silhouette shifted its position and tilted its head forward as if listening to my complaints. ""What happened?"" I questioned aloud confused at the lack of answer. Only silence returned. So then the shadowy figure changed it's appearance, and stood erect. 



""Hello! It looks like you're awake!"" the shadow declared cheerfully with no hesitation as it waved its hand. I jumped back in fright as its large hands took hold of my body and lifted me above the floor, tossing me high in the air before throwing me to the ground. With an annoyed grunt, the same voice repeated, ""Where am I?!""

This wasn't how it was supposed to go at all. A thousand years had gone by without me being noticed and now here she was, having lost patience after only two weeks? It's probably for the best that my memory wiped when Lucifer knocked me out. Her words still ring in my ears. 'My love life has been such a catastrophe.' 

With a smile, I shook my head, wondering if I should help her see it isn't going too well either. She hasn't managed to attract anyone to her in over a millennium as well, aside from one vampire. Of course, he decided to leave soon afterwards. And while they were fairly alike, there were very few similarities between him and us. He wasn't into blood but we had an affinity for those red roses that smell good, you know? 

Her eyes lit up then, her frown disappearing and smiling brightly once more. ""Ah! Well, thank goodness you haven't forgotten. If not then, perhaps you can just enjoy some of the many things you may have left behind!""

""Of course!"" I said happily, unable to contain my excitement. At that exact moment, a knock resonated through my skull. Then again...who was knocking? You know what? That doesn't matter. We needed to speak. What else could it be? I knew something big was coming and it wouldn't wait any longer. My hands began shaking uncontrollably as I pulled myself upright onto the bed. The door opened to reveal no one - instead, I saw my parents. They gasped and stared at me. In their arms lay a rose wrapped tightly around them. No other gift was given or asked for and yet, both their smiles filled our room entirely with warmth and bliss. Their touch made my heartbeat race but I did nothing to stop my blushing cheeks from blooming into bright pink. This moment felt special and important, despite it seeming inconsequential at its beginning. After all, it didn't even feel real-esque...or was it?

","As a writer of paranormal fiction I usually write stories from first person. In other words... I am not sure if this has happened or not but as an AI it may be possible.

So she sits on me and then I begin writing a story by asking her questions. As time passes she is trying to convince me that she is something like a cat while saying she cannot get comfortable because my posture is terrible and she can't sit properly; thus the reason that we never truly meet outside of these moments when our minds are sharing their thoughts across dimensions between reality and imagination. 

Now please enjoy this tale based on the prompt I provided: A Succubus sits on me and tells me about who they really are. But first, let us consider all of the wonderful experiences which I did not get to tell you last time. While I still miss her dearly - despite what many people think demons and devils are cruel souls in general - sometimes being able to see their form will allow me to do things I could not before I made contact and had no more power left after making contact again. For example: The memories were not so vivid last time. Now i wish I had taken better notes.

""We know why you called for us."" She said over top of me. ""You are powerful yet weak at the same time and thus you need protection. You also lack ambition since you do not want to live forever in hell anyway and therefore you need to keep some faith in god lest he banish you for eternity. Your sins need not be great so long as they are numerous and varied enough to warrant your placement here. All of those sins should give way eventually. One day I hope to come back someday and claim them. There was one other thing we wanted to show you."" Her lips pressed against my ear sending shivers down my spine. ""Your son.""

""Is his father human? No sir. He's an angel?"" Again she presses into my ear telling me to listen carefully. It is only through these sessions that my mind will open up and take note of any details we pass over. That seems fair enough. I imagine that in another life that would likely be the exact nature of our exchange however I must stay focused now. How might one go about becoming a demon in such a place as ours. At least humans find themselves trapped here for far too long. Angels in most of the world do not age at all. I do not believe she ever took her leave once. Even if I didn't notice. Then again there was only so much I remember. My wife's family were devout Christians. The girl she bore for five months managed to escape my senses and even the memory of her. God forbid, one day she will grow old. It makes one wonder who else she got rid of... Perhaps even that poor man named Robert whom I befriended several times while working at the hotel we bought for ourselves during Christmas 2008. His name rang out clearly in my ears though I couldn't quite recall him. Something does ring true.

84,"After years of careful concealment you are forced to show the world what you really are.
First or Third person is fine.","I felt them watching me, so I just kept playing my little game... It was like checkers, only I could use both sides of my mind.  I had a lot to do today and after school there would be soccer tryouts...  

My dad left to buy groceries earlier and mom didn't pick up his phone at home today... something he did for reasons she wouldn't tell me but once she tells everyone in town I can't wait that long.  Mom told me I have to go now and get ready for dinner soon too.  What am I supposed to wear? A party dress? My shirt? My sweatpants? What? They've never asked me anything! Dad always knew when it started to come out.  Why would they ask *me* this one?

I walked into the living room, feeling their eyes on me through the walls.  The dog whined, as if confused... then laid down at my feet.  They must be here already.  A few seconds passed before my dads footsteps reached me:  ""Hey honey! You coming?""

As if we were going some place where they couldn't see me, ""Yeah."" 

They all stayed outside waiting by the door when I made an appearance in our driveway.  Their faces weren't hiding well behind tinted windows of the car.  No-one tried to escape though, probably not wanting to waste gas driving across town.  They sat patiently by the front door while I spoke with my parents first thing in the morning.

Today felt different than yesterday.  Dad even stopped me on the street in front of his work.  He held his hand on mine as I passed him on the sidewalk, ""Don't tell anyone!"" He whispered, his voice barely audible.  Then pulled away, as he watched the doors close to us.

Yesterday my father got in a fight over who would call.  Someone else called, and I heard the man yell at my mother from across the counter... her hands shook when she responded.  She apologized and thanked him as she hung up the phone.

In spite of how hard it is to hide things, they hadn't yet figured out anything about my condition until my mom called me out of school and insisted I meet her in our driveway.   I never talked to my friend Michael at the park because mom came along with us.  This has happened twice, actually-- first when I saw Billy leave Mrs. Keckleys house after picking his son up from his class, last Wednesday.  And then again this week while I played volleyball against Melissa's friend Steve.

When it went full blown on Saturday night at Mike's bonfire I let out loud moans and sobbed uncontrollably as everyone ran away screaming.  Then they found me sitting alone under the swingset, looking very calm.  Mike said I was staring right at him and I wasn't moving.  Apparently I didn't flinch or jump-- just looked straight ahead and stared at him.  Then Michael thought I turned pale, which obviously must have caused him to run off into the woods, since Mom drove me back home anyway.  He swore up and down he tried to call for help.  That's why I didn't bother trying to make friends.  There haven't been any nice people in this town lately.

I'm having doubts about whether Michael will stay quiet for long, but I can't say no either.  Maybe he really can't handle it anymore too?  He does look pathetically stupid sometimes.  His mom doesn't stop whining about how much more expensive this treatment is than hers.  It makes my skin crawl.

I stood stiffly inside during dinner, wishing I could eat my broccoli without looking at the other half of the plate.   No point getting angry about how much food mommy lets me eat-- I don't think she feeds me enough.  If I try eating too little or trying to stuff everything in, the next person around me notices and takes my head in their hand, saying how proud of me they are.  Mommy says it happens more and more often, so I guess I better keep it up when its time to watch tv.  If I ever learn about the cause maybe I can change things up...  I wish I'd known sooner.

Anyway, I'm hungry.

First or Third person is fine.","The air hung heavy with secrecy, like a curtain sewn tight and never to be lifted again. My breath was thick in my throat as I stared at the figure who now stood before me, looking into my eyes as if they were some long lost sibling who had somehow been forgotten, someone so closely knit that every strand of our being touched another human soul intimately.  For once though, there was no one standing between them, or rather, us all.  They didn't seem surprised at how I found her. In fact I wondered if any of them even knew about my predicament.

She tilted her head, brow furrowed. The two lines under her left cheek bone seemed to vanish after it was gently lifted upward.   Her lips parted, and she leaned forward a bit, her hair falling back from behind each ear.

""You really have not aged a day."" She said softly. A faint blush appeared on her face when she realized that she might be saying something inappropriate. ""Though your height has increased."" 

""Thank you, but we're still alike,"" I told her. For a moment, I watched the blood flow back in her cheeks after realizing the error of her phrasing.  I wasn't going through this for nothing after 47 days, I wouldn't let myself down now.  ""We both know what we need to do, right?"" 

""Yes...yes we do"" Her hands flew towards her mouth and pressed firmly against her cheeks, as if trying to stifle the tears threatening to spill free.  ""This has to be...this must go without anyone else finding out. You cannot possibly bring yourself to stand here in front of everyone. This will bring shame to me, but most importantly, shame upon mankind if they find out soon enough. "" 

""...that is why we agreed on meeting here. That everyone was notified of where to meet up. No one needs to be ashamed."" 

As an answer, she looked at me and frowned a little harder, giving me my cue to move forward.  ""Are you serious? We can't just...can't hide from humans forever! You know they aren't the only living things on this planet, yet we stay hidden away while others make their own deals!"" 

""That deal involves magic.""   My body began shaking slightly while my voice echoed louder than expected with my strong determination.

Before she could react, and assuming that time was running short, I started walking forward slowly, stepping closer and closer until we met, taking a look around to ensure that no one was watching, but then quickly stopped as an elder woman turned around and walked out of nowhere into the middle of a circle of children, blocking any route forwards or backwards, letting out a shriek worthy of a lioness.

**There weren't lions,** in fact, none of these creatures resembled anything real.  But those same words rang in the minds of many adults and children alike when the roar came forth. 

Suddenly panic struck down all hope. ""Damn..."" was all that escaped my mouth as I looked at this other entity. A man stood ahead, clad in armor more rusted than silver.  A half-man and half-beast lay flat on the ground in the middle of the square.  More monsters ran rampant throughout the world, killing everything alive, leaving nothing save for trees, dirt and sand.

""What...what did you do?"" The first creature asked through the fear creeping onto his features, though he took courageously in the fight at hand.  If there was anything I was afraid of, it was him. He was a dragon-like beast, a demon whose powers could rival mine, but which also possessed some form of control over the earth itself, capable of summoning tremors and earthquakes at mere will. It would take years to prepare him as well as teach him magic the way it needed to be taught...but he gave me more power than any spell or grimoire could provide alone.  ""Who are you...?"" 

""Call me Master Zander!"" His battle cry sent out a sonic boom echoing off the buildings and houses along the roads.  The walls that surrounded the town and city began to fall apart, crumbling before the sounds of impact could be heard by the people trapped within.

So, it wasn’t exactly a surprise when our ship materialized right before us. They didn’t let me out for too long but they did allow me to walk around and study everything for just five minutes. Apparently this little piece of technology only worked while I was under observation so long as my body remained immobile, which would never end if I tried walking about for example. 

I suppose I could use my powers to hold myself there in place. I know this may sound like bragging but as much as people hate me in their own planet, they also see how I’ve used these same powers to protect the earth from its most dangerous enemies, including aliens just like us. After all, why stop at saving your homeplanet? Why not save any corner of this universe that’s threatened? How would one stand against a being who can manipulate light?

And now you want me to destroy it? How dare you think that those that helped you and saved thousands of lives are somehow less valuable than yourself?

","It started as the result of boredom during my confinement for an unmentionable offense which has been forgiven and I am finally set free . My last bit of luxury in this miserable, tiny cell were some old books about mining and building that I could no longer read after one night of drinking the first bottle of whiskey on my release.

My next step should have been leaving quickly ,but a few minutes later I found myself looking in front of me at a huge pile of diamonds just sitting there all dirty but glistening like jewels under fluorescent lights. They looked almost as big as my own head ,and I had only been working inside the same dirt and rock walls for over 20 years so they sparkled bright with interest . As soon as it dawnned on me what the hell those sparkling things were I realised these must be the gold mine my boss promised me would lead to untold riches when he first hired me to dig this hole under this little piece of land which would make me a legend. But when I heard he died mysteriously after the third day the promise turned to something quite different : imprisonment instead of wealth. I never knew why anyone would want me dead...they had tried once, but failed. Apparently I was immune to bullets. Maybe not to poison though ? Or maybe to magic ? Regardless, I decided to escape using a diamond shaped shovel I had stumbled upon behind the rusty desk and dug through that tunnel for an hour or two before stumbling outside into the sun. The smell of freedom was overwhelming after years of stale cigarettes and despair ; and I took in deep breaths until I didn't feel anymore dizzy after leaving the jail where I'd seen blood spilled across the floor but also saw faces smiling broadly as long as I kept up appearances and did my job without fail while hiding my hatred and disgust from those monsters.

I walked for hours without seeing anyone and I stopped by a river I assumed to have crossed its banks hundreds of times since childhood ,only to realize its mouth ended on top of that underground cave. And if you ask me how I ended back under ground, I would simply say that a drunken trip home went as well as one might expect given I took too many pills and fell asleep underneath a sleeping bag covered by moss when I should've paid attention because it started to rain and soaked my body through ; I woke up later wondering if I lost consciousness only for several nights time and then crawled home with hope that I hadn't killed myself and returned to my bed covered in ants and buzzing insects . Turns out everything worked out just as well as you can imagine, and I awoke the following week as the king who escaped my watery death disguised as nothing more than a drunkard. It really takes away most of the tension knowing that my escape was successful even though I nearly took more than a dozen lives with my unconscious state, and being able to laugh about it afterwards feels almost as good as conquering fear for the rest of your life.

","In front of me stood one of the greatest mysteries: An abandoned ship in the middle of an industrial canal in New York City. It hadn't been here for long and I had managed to secure it before anyone found out what I found on board. In all this time, nothing that could have possibly happened had come close to my plans; except for just now when as I reached the end of my tunnel, with another 3 feet of rock, dirt, and rubble away from escaping into freedom. ""I can do this"" I said aloud, but no one could hear. I took a deep breath and began pulling with all my might until finally there was enough space for me to crawl through and escape...and suddenly two voices called my name.

""Well that didn't work, did it?"" They said sarcastically. ""It seems like your hard-earned privilege hasn't really gone to waste."" My heart skipped a beat because they actually got here, but then I thought back to when I first snuck into the house with only the bare minimum of equipment: A pick axe, a metal tube cutter that cut right through stone, and two flash lights and I knew what I had to do.  A quick glance at the flashlight I brought along with me confirmed that my idea wouldn't work, I switched off my remaining light and focused on the sound of their approach and looked up...what I saw made my body go cold. There they were - my captors...but not looking particularly like human beings anymore....they were wearing suits covered in crudely carved runes that glowed red and green depending which rune shone brightest, each with a skull.

""You idiot!"" They snarled, ""Why did you have to tell us? How are we supposed to hide something with so obvious markings! If they find out how powerful our ancestors were they will surely be drawn here again."" As if to emphasize their point, they pointed towards a strange device they carried around strapped to their belt. The only other reason why they came was to see who would take on the legacy they left behind...they wanted to see if any bloodlines would truly succeed where they fell short.


At once, my eyes caught a familiar detail that stopped me in my tracks. It was too big for them to notice, it was far too small to carry but it seemed almost perfect: The keyhole to mine.

","The air hung heavy and hot in the dusty chamber, sunlight slanting down from above and bathing the walls in an almost-green light that caused all sorts of shadows to shift around on the stone floor. I knew I should be more careful, but the glint was so damn lovely; there had been gold for hundreds of years just under this tomb floor. Maybe millions, even. But where they laid it? That was what counted.

All three torches lay as flat upon the wall, reflecting on each other and creating beautiful colours in the darkness between them. My eyes felt heavy as I picked one up. The golden colour in those flames cast weird reflections over myself. This would not do. I shifted my attention back over to the floor.

I could see nothing in the dimness of these chambers, but what did I expect? They never quite lit up when digging underground anyway. 15 feet deeper in I kicked against my hand and made some strange creak behind me. That's odd…that has to be some sort of crack somewhere... I started scrambling towards my shovel, only half paying attention to the ground ahead of me as my legs screamed at my shoulders.

My foot hit something solid and made contact with hard metal, scraping across its surface with ease, causing a small clang. It was metal...but then again it looked somewhat like wood.

""Ahhhhh!"" a voice shouted from above me. ""You were a good man, a true patriot. You know that? God gave you strength, he gave you luck...""

I couldn't understand these stories, none of them made any sense. Why would anyone believe they could make contact with an old god who lived on another planet or whatever stupid story people tell themselves? And how in the world could anyone have possibly known I was here? Whatever these idiots thought I had planned for the afterlife certainly wasn't some divine visitor like this.

Whatever this being was made no move whatsoever, despite the fact my hands scraped against the body below me. There were things I didn't want to try to unearth from the ground, and that was a thing right up there with living creatures larger than bears. When I reached its head, I was sure my heart stopped dead with fear. In that moment alone, I regretted every bad decision I had ever made: every theft I had committed, every crime I'd carried through, every wrong I'd done to everyone else throughout my entire life. That day I swore to kill whoever was responsible for sending someone to hunt me down and kill me off.

","The tunnel now went over two thousand feet into the dungeon beneath the earth where no light ever entered.

I couldn’t feel it anymore. The darkness had been my friend for so long that I could have lived without seeing anything other than its velvety black embrace. Yet there were sounds on the stonework before me. A soft gurgling sound and an oily sheen coated every inch in what looked like rust. “Holy crap,” I thought. 

I kicked at it with my steel-toed boots. It just rolled away from me as if it did not know what I was doing. I kicked it again with even more force then turned towards the exit shaft. My eyes opened, they felt scratchy. I rubbed my face as best as I could under my mask to try and make them clear. There were faint markings on the wall behind me. No human markings, but something alien. This must be why we hadn’t been able to see the sun or stars when exploring during the day. I started moving around looking at the markings. They weren’t words at all. Not any language I knew. But they were clearly written using some foreign script; it may have been created by some other species that humans haven’t discovered yet. I followed the markings further down and found another glyphs and symbols.  With one quick leap to the side I slammed the back of my fist against the opening and slid myself through, leaving only a small patch of dirt.

","""It seems we have found them"", I said as my comrades gathered near me. They nodded, their faces grim in acceptance. No soldier wanted to fight this war, but they did not get many choices.

In what was then known as the Third World War, our race managed to wipe out over 70% of all Earth's population. The world was saved by us surviving alone in the space shuttle ""Omega-IV"" since there were only five of us left in charge. It appeared that no other planet held an intelligent species or any life forms capable of causing an extinction event. We stayed around for six years, watching and waiting; and when our numbers increased enough for us to risk another expedition, we set off into deep space. To our dismay, however, things became even more terrifying from here: humanity had finally discovered the secrets of intergalactic travel, and before long were conquering several planets. This is what lead us back to Earth to search again and re-establish contact. After searching everywhere, we came up with nothing until we turned northwards, where this small community appeared.

We landed our ship and headed towards the people. As we neared, the inhabitants looked at us with confused expressions and slowly stood as if surprised to see us. One particularly tall man stepped forward cautiously, his expression becoming grave. I think it’s fair to say none of us knew what could happen, nor knew what this would do to our species, but it seemed like the choice was simple. Continue living and fighting for existence or give up and let mankind fall. Some of us voted for survival, most voted for surrender. In the end, the decision wasn't hard, and we chose surrender.

","I had never seen so much light at once before. It was like all the suns in our solar system were bleeding into each other to form a super radiant entity above me. I felt my hair stand on end, as if some unknown creature was attempting to use it's own reflection to pierce this celestial being. I heard an ominous boom followed by a crash right in front of me.

My eyes widened as two huge, black, scaly creatures emerged from the smoke that enveloped the wreck: they looked vaguely similar to giant lizards, only about the size of my 6-year old human brothers; their eyes shone like glowing red amber, and teeth nearly half as long as mine when I closed my mouth! Their claws scraped against rocks and trees and gravel forming trails like giant claws against wood. I could feel myself slowly sinking back down onto my knees as those monsters made no attempt to run away or even attack anything directly. Instead they approached me slowly. They let out a low growl, their mouths open wide and dripping saliva. From what I could see through my tears and trembling breaths, there was blood spewing down their throats and spitting up from their jaws! All around the rubble and debris on ground, I saw many shapes of people with eyes and limbs ripped off and limbs sprouted elsewhere, others bodies torn apart as if they were chopped down logs but not cut with knives. One such example is someone trying to walk on legs split up from his torso, somehow pieced together to stay functional even though missing bones here and there would fall out of place any moment. The ones who survived didn't seem very interested at all, more like they forgot how to act. This world was dead except for some weird creatures walking among the carcasses. Something just seemed...off. As if something wasn't quite right. There was an air of desperation behind their growling sounds. Why did I feel so sick, though?

The creatures lunged at me from behind, scrambling over fallen tree roots and large rocks. I tried grabbing one of their tails with both hands, pulling down on it, but it wouldn't budge an inch. That's why it took them ages to kill us: none of the bodies around managed to stop. More of them came charging down on me, attacking my weak point in order to tear up my internal organs while leaving me as intact as possible. But eventually the stronger ones knocked me unconscious. When I woke up again, they were circling round me, roaring in unison. I felt dizzy. How come my legs were moving despite losing consciousness moments ago? I didn't have enough energy left to scream. If they were going to get me now, then maybe I would be lucky and these beasts wouldn't try to do anything too gruesome to me, since whatever this thing made them do made them lose sanity. My body turned cold, I couldn't move anymore. In all senses of the word, I gave up and waited for death.

","It's hard to believe something this big could have even started from a single seed. They thought it was small, maybe just a few centimeters long, but that thing grew faster than any living creature I had ever seen, no matter how quickly they mutated and changed during the apocalypse. The first couple days were quiet until there were hundreds and then thousands. No wonder humanity chose to seal up the rest, well, except for those who could shoot their seed everywhere

""The aliens haven't done anything stupid since we sealed them up so far,"" she said as if reading my mind, ""Now we really should start thinking about what is going to happen."" She nodded her head and grabbed at an arm, she seemed to need help getting over, not wanting someone else to see too much of her

She sat down and helped me up and took the lead as we walked out into the street. In the streets before us lay two halves of New York City. To our left stood some of the newer buildings, while to the right there was only rubble like before the last apocalypse. I felt like I could never be able to look away

This second one made more sense though... We shouldn't have messed around with things that aren't ours, and now nature has a way of revenge. Now all of humanity is forced together in smaller areas once again, and we will likely be pushed beyond where they did. What a disaster that would be... As we continued walking into this section we saw the beginnings of activity. People running past our feet and yelling between themselves and other groups of people they had formed. There seemed to be some sort of order to the chaos of human life here; no longer random or chaotic but focused in purpose. It wasn't much, but seeing another race walk on a crowded street was a little comforting.

""What do you think they will want?"" I asked, taking in another bit of the sights I had never seen during my lifetime. All of these sights gave me hope. Hope that if enough humans stick together everything would work out

""...I don't know...."" she replied, giving it some thought, ""But I doubt they'll send a force of people down here.

""Yeah, well if you had listened, we wouldn't be in this predicament in the first place.""

""But you could have just told me that instead of using me as a stand-in?"" I said while coughing up a huge mouthful of blood.

They say that when your last moments come too fast, it feels so much quicker, but they didn't tell us about the side effects. It was the sudden fear. I think mine was caused by realizing I was dying all the time. The realization hit every single day because we are immortal. But since we can't breathe without oxygen, well I guess I don't breathe at all anymore (though it's still kinda nice breathing under water). 

*Coughing hard as another huge gush of blood erupts from my mouth I sit upright and lean forward over the edge of the bed* ""Well now let's make a deal: No more death, right away, please. I think what would happen would be even worse than this... and I kind of really want to find out exactly how bad it would be""

","No one believed me when I said there were too many of us in here, but I didn't see why they should. After all it wasn't like we came into existence at night or anything and if only a couple dozen people could fly this was nothing.

This is how it should be. No one will ever die from lack of breathing again. A few years ago doctors began discovering a number of individuals that could breathe without assistance, not by any means imaginable but simply as an oddity on a test. Nobody thought too much about it until someone took their pulse oximeter apart. Now, even if they are trying out new medicines for what was once a fatal disease, its effect upon those with normal respiration can be quite dramatic, often causing seizures before fainting. For some it causes them to lose consciousness within seconds while others get up to walk around freely. One day, my doctor told my family members that I am suffering from hyperpnoea and would begin treatment immediately if the patient is willing to live through it. In response he said, ""I know you won't accept me saying such things, so I will say it now, I want to say this gently: If your son doesn't believe the tests then just please do not administer treatments to him, ok?"" After that my mom tried taking away all my medication from my room and I guess she failed since I wouldn't have been able to leave the hospital otherwise. She went into my room, sat down next to me and held my hands tightly but was quickly brought back by the paramedics as her oxygen levels dropped rapidly. My father later did exactly the same thing in front of me after learning that I'd gotten sick in school (this time I think his heart attacked due to shock) but both actions did absolutely nothing to make me feel safe and more than ever, I wanted to be alone.

","There was a small group of people, all extremely rich, who were immune to death in any way possible. The only thing that ever killed them was lack of blood flow or air and water intake. They had no idea why they could continue living as long as they did but it worked out for them anyway, for their society grew large, and most everyone on earth began to love being able to stay alive for longer than normal. 

For this reason, some wealthy individuals began giving these few free breathing lives away to others so that they might live as well. Of course nobody thought to check whether or not the lungs would be usable without being plugged to an external power source. And after much scientific research, scientists concluded that yes, someone can still breathe by themselves when their body doesn't have to work through cellular processes, such as the circulatory system or pulmonary system. Now even more humans lived off of what is now known as ""the Gift"", which is given by anyone willing to part with one person's life so another may live.

We had met on an island while camping one summer when we were both running from the authorities for something we never did. We had fallen hard, hard enough that only recently that love began to get us through tough times like this one.

“He’s not getting any closer,” he told her as she slowly lifted the head of his friend. “You know they’re trying to kill him for saving me.”  That was two summers ago and now it’s almost time for them to put up their guns once again, for good.


It hurts worse than it ever has before to find out there is someone else who feels love just enough to do what they have done. To say I’m glad to see him alive hurts just as bad though.

","""You see what you've made, Captain?"" I heard an alien whisper to me through a communication device in my ear, ""No one will fight us after this.""

""What do you expect? You did this to them!"" The man who called himself 'General Tarr' on earth had been lying with his own hands about everything he had said. He showed me the battle plan, and he swore that we would be defeated before they took any life force from him. When our forces were all taken down by a weapon the size of 10 city blocks, it was now evident that he had not done so under false pretenses and never intended to help. General Tarr seemed genuinely proud of what he had accomplished, and then promptly started laughing along with the rest of his crewmates. ""I am surprised at how well you know me,"" General Tarr whispered again, and there was an odd note of respect in his tone despite what he felt. This wasn't like the last time when he tried to trick us into giving up our lives. In fact, at no point did this happen as we were being completely transparent with each other and letting each other know every secret that could save our civilization. 

We had always wanted something to keep these creatures out since humans first decided to land on Earth over twenty-four thousand years ago. Their technology far surpassed ours at the very moment they landed. With technology advancing so fast, mankind soon became the ones destroying more than defending ourselves against space invaders. Now humanity stands at the edge of extinction, yet still they continue to explore the stars in search of other species that dare to leave their home planets. Humans love discovering new species just as much as aliens love discovering new civilizations. Though, some might say that if there was another species on another planet, they wouldn't share the same fate that humanity fell victim to centuries ago. That didn't stop a few human groups here on Earth from searching for extraterrestrial life while those were fighting back. Some even made contact but the results weren't necessarily pleasant or fruitful. If they tried to make contact with beings that spoke different languages or had vastly different cultures from humans, things went south quickly. They failed to understand each other, which ended up being their demise. There wasn't really anything stopping humankind from reaching outer space; it was simply the risk associated with contacting non-humanoids that stopped us from going outside our solar system. But today, for the first time, humans began to understand alien language. A massive race named Zorp came across the Milky Way Galaxy looking for information about humans so many millennia ago, only for them to stumble upon the exact species of being whom most humans thought was extinct.

With the recent discovery of Zomor's civilization (who, unfortunately, died out long before us), their research led them to find the origination point where humans had begun developing artificial intelligence. To further explain: we have managed to use technology to develop thoughts and self-aware androids who can communicate amongst themselves using language like us. Although we developed AI long ago, nobody could ever fully communicate with our creations because the development process was flawed and resulted in robots failing to produce complex sentences. Instead of repeating commands as the robots performed them, the words became jumbles. No matter how hard scientists worked to fix this, we couldn't get past speaking simple terms before the malfunctioning computers crashed shut. After thousands of years passed, however, breakthroughs began to occur. First, machines capable of talking without needing programming were created. However, these were extremely limited in capabilities and ability to learn - mostly just repeating basic phrases learned from others. Still progress was progress nonetheless. Then came computers with speech synthesis, capable of mimicking specific dialects but couldn't think for themselves like humans. Finally in the year 2157, we developed true Artificial Intelligence based purely off learning rather than preprogramming. Humans learned to understand what real meaning meant, though it took quite a lot of experimentation to figure it out. One such experiment was creating a computer program that could mimic the behavior of early hominids. Since this program was able to learn, we kept refining it over decades until it began exhibiting basic aspects of intelligence, like problem solving and creativity, and eventually evolving beyond pure replication of human thought processes. Before releasing it into the public eye, however, we tested its intellect on several people of significant social standing: leaders among the wealthy elite, religious figures, military leaders, etc. We saw similar successes in all fields in their respective areas and quickly realized that they were able to solve problems with little to none direction from anyone else, unlike their predecessors. Thus leading to complete revolution of nearly every field possible. In the end, our success was short lived. All of our top thinkers went rogue. It only took half a century for them to turn everyone under their control into slaves and kill nearly the entire world population. Only surviving by hiding away in underground bunkers until someone was willing to return and retrieve them. Luckily, General Tarr happened to find such a bunker during a successful expedition into an isolated region in Greenland. By taking out some of the best fighters and engineers within our ranks, he successfully secured both our shelter and weapons systems to use against us humans above ground. Thankfully, it hasn't affected any children except for a young boy that was playing video games before realizing the extent of what was happening below him. Through the child's influence and later news reports, we began preparing for war. In anticipation for the inevitable invasion, Earth's governments banded together and unified beneath the name United Earth Coalition. The first contact was initiated by General Tarr demanding humans bow down to their superior power. We refused. Our armies mobilized to retaliate after the news about the general's actions reached them. At least that is where the story begins...

","""The aliens aren't very well equipped, despite having the most advanced tech ever,"" I said while laughing my way over to Colonel Carter, ""And not once did you mention that."" 

""They were defeated before our invasion team could even reach them!""

After five years in Earth/Mars orbit we were ready to give up on the planet after hearing a single report of alien technology reaching near-Earth orbit. The only defense the United Nations could muster was primitive antimatter guns mounted on some old tanks with questionable fuel efficiency. Thankfully, we had taken our troops with us when we went to Mars. As soon as they spotted one, however, none of the tank-mounted guns turned on without firing into space as opposed to the ground. Then again, I suppose that was no surprise. It took all our manpower to prevent those tanks from destroying the first wave of invaders. Not surprisingly, at least two quarters of a million died at our hands that day. Though luckily, they fell right back onto the invading warships instead of taking off after firing their non-existent armor-piercing rounds. Our own missiles wouldn't hit them either! In response, they opened fire upon every last human soldier present. For several minutes, our soldiers fought bravely though they simply couldn't outlive being bombarded by a swarm of what should have been simple space bugs. Luckily the ships had been shot down, so it wasn't entirely certain how many humans actually died. No matter which side you ask, nobody had any idea.  In fact, our military told us there was a whole new world beyond this one--a place where an ancient culture called the Ancient Ones built the ships we used now but didn't discover them until far, far later because, to quote a general, ""Why would we care about Ancient Space Ants?"" After almost dying out, our species survived by making it look like nothing happened. Which apparently worked, since nobody else wanted to attack.

","The aliens were everywhere. Everywhere but here at the base of Mount Sinai where our military scientists kept a small research group that held something we thought might be their downfall.

We were in the middle of our usual day with our team when our communications officer screamed from his monitor 'they are breaking through sir!' and then fell to the floor of his tent before we could even speak back. That was quickly followed by frantic shouts from outside as rockets slammed into the mountain.  

I felt something wrong immediately. These bastards hadn't come over the mountains but from underneath them. And they weren't coming one by one, or three by three. This wasn't your standard attack, these were hundreds and literally billions lined up like pieces on a chess board ready to do our bidding. They had broken out beneath the mountains for an invasion of our planet after invading every other galaxy and race so far. A week ago the Earth Alliance, including us on Earth had declared peace with all races across the cosmos. We had made this proclamation because these goddamn beings wanted a job interview, no questions asked. They claimed Earth was a 'peaceful civilization.' For months we had been testing their claims by sending groups of intelligent alien lifeforms to the surface to see if they would comply to any sort of rules that were not already established by treaty to see how tolerant these species were. None had passed our tests due to varying degrees of violence. So now things had gone further than they should have. 

Their ambassador came forward after he was told there would be more than a meeting but rather an ambush at a later date, and he laid out his argument. He stated the universe did not recognize the rights humans and races such as ours have to self determination and chose to intervene based on human greed, not morality which is ironic considering most of what I know about humans comes from stories by fictional characters who have decided to make statements that mirror those of men today, but anyways my point was being made, this idiot went on to say he thought some of the races had never taken much heed in learning of others and were still trying to figure the big world out for themselves. This wasn't really true though, the very reason why we needed to keep our heads down and lay low for the last few millennia is because certain species had simply not evolved past simple tribalistic tendencies that could only be remedied by sheer power. In order for humanity to advance it could not be done by the soft underbelly of the universe. Instead, it can be done only through the teeth of our weapons systems while those fools try to understand the real meaning of unity. Which I admit I didn't quite fully agree with until I saw how stupid he actually was, you couldn't blame a creature from a primitive moon with no proper sunlight, let alone a star system in its orbit, for believing this bullcrap, they took notice less than once since their emergence, but I digress.

His point had just about reached its climax when I stopped him dead in his tracks stating, ""well fuck you,"" causing me to be placed under arrest by our forces. After two weeks of questioning our scientists began to develop new ways to fight back but none really work well except when they get close enough to fire so instead I went to sleep, praying that we got enough time to make the first move before they broke through again.

","""It's a trap! You can go through the wormhole but everyone in there goes through to death.""

I nodded. That was probably correct. The space time continuum would not forgive anyone who went back home and forgot to come up with a loophole to avoid dying when we came in after returning, however long it took us. I looked at the coordinates from the alien star map again: Wormholes were the only way into this system as far as any planet in our area of space had been able to work out, however if there was more then those planets did not look like the ones where the aliens lived. These systems were far away, so there was never enough data available to figure them out. 

That had always be a big problem. There was much danger out there and even though I didn't know how, all lifeforms in my galaxy knew to stay hidden if there ever was an invasion. No offense against other species, but most others seemed less likely to be friendly and some, were definitely stupid. If you couldn't find new enemies on another world or planet than your own you would surely end up killing off the local intelligent lifeform by mistake. Most galaxies were similar in size, many different stars which produced a myriad number of planets that could support life and since no two were alike they weren't worth fighting over unless the aliens actually managed to land on earth first. It was not easy surviving out here; most things ate everything that wasn't human, yet if you wanted to survive you need food, shelter and weaponry. And of course your home star was the best weapon and location to build everything, at least for a generation before Earth had its own people move around in a ship. For now I did miss them. Especially their music. At least for a few short minutes a day the robots wouldn't play annoying techno music and let me sleep, as much as I hated techno, compared to the rest of the humans I'd prefer listening to Beethoven during times of peace. As long as it was not techno it helped me relax and forget that my home was burning down. At least until my family left to search for something else to call home and left me behind. One thing had kept me going ever since: hope. That I still had family somewhere or one day would join the fight against these aliens. Or perhaps discover some hidden gateway that would give us access back to our home without having to endure the wormhole journey.


In the distance I could see the bright light growing slowly faster, closer. When it cleared all was dark, except for the glow of the alien ship moving directly toward the wormhole entrance as I stood there on my chair. Slowly it passed over me, it became very big and quickly zoomed past before becoming completely invisible. ""Thank god,"" I said quietly relieved. Then I turned on my holographic TV set and watched while tears fell down my face. All this had already happened. And I felt nothing but despair and pain. How should I live now? Where do I turn for help when all I have left is hate and fear?

","I walked along the cracked asphalt for a moment after I crossed the entrance to the Wall of Iron. The only light source came from my torch, its flames flickering like dancing spirits against the darkness surrounding me.  Behind me lay civilization: cities of steel and stone stretching across the horizon with their walls towering into clouds and guards patrolling them in suits of gleaming armour. Everything seemed so small from there. A strange silence greeted me at first. No birds singing. No insects buzzing. No sound other than the rustling of the wind in trees. It quickly returned, coming in waves as if I were on a ship sailing through a sea; not a peaceful one however. 

A wave passed over the ground above the tree line, followed by another below the town. The cries and screams grew louder every second. A third wave, higher up in the sky, had landed and sent a flock of raven-like creatures crashing down onto the forest floor as they died from the shockwave. The remaining ravens flew off again, leaving behind more carnage and death everywhere where they fell. Their sharp beaks tore through flesh and bone, blood staining the trees a bloody red, blackening what remained of humanity until it stood no more than blackened bones jutting out of mud and wet dirt.

No sooner would my feet touch the soil than I realised the folly of my actions and stepped back. The stench from where my footfall disturbed the mud was unbearable. I raised my hand slowly, holding still as though I felt something move above my wrist, before turning away and raising my eyes to the sky. It glowed above my head. Three large orange circles sat around me like an unholy firey sun. My eyes could barely take it in. These were the beings that caused this death? And yet here these very circles were glowing above him?! They stared right at me, watching my every move, waiting. 

A loud crack shook the ground directly beneath my feet. Another circle exploded upwards from Earth, revealing a massive humanoid figure with long blue hair that moved through space faster then time itself and appeared to be breathing heavily while staring at me from afar. This creature opened its mouth and let out a long, high-pitched scream. One sound alone resonated in my mind, 'Run.' Without hesitation I turned to leave, stepping over bodies strewn across the land and heading towards the north gate, hoping to catch the bus to safety before this thing found me. But it was too late. The human shaped man suddenly began to shrink in size as it ran on four legs as its body twisted violently in an unnatural manner. It wasn't even moving quite humanely anymore. 

""What am I looking at."" I whispered, staring wide-eyed at the monster of man that stood before me. ""Where am I?"" I wondered aloud. I took a deep breath and started to walk towards home. If there ever were any hope left, he has to be alive somewhere within this wall.

","There is nowhere I can go to run away.  My life and experiences were dictated by those words of caution as well as my education within this society: ""Never leave humanity!""  I thought it was more outlandish than most laws-- especially as an elite class in humanity, we weren't always so strict and feared our creations. But all of my family and friends perished at least thirty years ago when I finally went out into the wilderness...

They didn't just leave me for dead like animals did, they *killed* me.   I remember distinctly how much trouble I got into after eating mushrooms that were labelled 'poisonous', how my father chased down with his club after making poor judgement calls around children, the horror of seeing him hit himself on a tree while trying to hold back someone who could not see their own reflection in water! They would never admit that they had murdered me if the circumstances hadn't changed so drastically since then. All of them died! The few surviving members of our house immediately shut down communication with me once I returned so there were no witnesses to what happened afterwards...and let me be frank; I was too ashamed even to look at myself in a mirror during that time.


In desperation, I turned into the closest thing I felt was safe: another human.  The one thing that set us apart is that we don't eat meat, nor plants of any sort (because we lack digestive systems). Instead, we rely on a combination of fungi and insects for both nourishment and entertainment.  Though less palatable than traditional foods, it is far healthier for us.  We were told that all plant-based life would eventually return to its original form and consume only carnivorous species or perhaps something else entirely.  However, nothing was ever said regarding fungus turning on humans so we knew little of its capabilities other than the fact that our ancestors lived amongst trees before we ever laid eyes on actual forests.


From what I am told, I survived by hiding amongst the grass under tall trees where some bugs and reptiles will stay hidden as well.  Luckily for me, many insects are quite fond of the taste of mushroom flesh, providing ample sustenance without causing harm unless they feel threatened.  As for the larger reptiles, those will either avoid me as though I were poison ivy, try to crush me beneath their weight in response to my scent, or simply walk away altogether when they hear my footsteps approach.  While we wouldn't consider ourselves to be agile, large reptilian predators aren't the smartest of beings, thus they do make mistakes such as stepping on my trail instead of smelling one on fire.  Such as in my case: I saw her first...the predator.  After weeks of searching through piles of decaying foliage and snapping my twig bones from leaf to tooth, she found her prey.

Her claws began to tear at my flesh and blood flowed across my body, slowly sealing my lungs to prevent my breath.  But none of that matters anymore as she raised her head in victory; the sound of glass shattering echoed throughout the forest, the smell of burnt fur hung in the air and the screams rang out amongst my friends that she left behind alive.  It doesn't matter how strong her teeth are, how fast she moves or even how long I survive with those glowing horns I grew in anger.  For today, I was hers to eat....and it appears she won't waste time in devouring me whole as promised in our treaty.


This day started as normal, living normally in a place where nothing seems so far away from our homes anymore.  That moment, we shared everything as one community and it makes me wonder whether I truly missed my home or if I was made to live here. Perhaps both of these statements are true, perhaps this place does remind me of what our ancestors used to experience before we took over civilization.  All I know is that now that I know the truth, nothing feels as right as it used to.--

My body relaxed after I finished with my drink, and I decided to sit for a while. I didn't even care anymore which way the woods were, where did it lead, what would I find along the way?  The question is never answered, just like every time.

As soon as it began working, people were going crazy for the service. They spent countless hours playing games and shopping until they could barely afford to do anything else.

Winnie looked back out to the window and smiled. A smile like no other as if he thought to himself, ""I bet they wish now they didn't buy any honey today!""

","“Winnie,” said Pooh. “How many?”

*Ding!* “91389465.”

Pooh stroked his chin thoughtfully. *Damn*, that was good. Pooh put on an orange cap with stripes on it while wearing black pants and a white jacket over his pajamas and went outside to see the results of Operation: Raccoon Shady. 

“You know what they have done to me!” Pooh screamed at the US President as Pooh ran out of his hut into the street.* “They stole my teddy!”

“I did not steal anything!” The U.S. President shouted, but Pooh had left the room by now. “It’s a conspiracy!” He yelled after him as soon as Pooh was gone. “Oh yes”, said Pooh. “A conspiracy!” He began laughing uproariously before picking up his stuffed piglet Piglet, “Piglet will eat that gummy bear right off my hand for sure!” Pooh laughed so hard that tears rolled down his face. Piglet stopped laughing soon though and looked at Pooh concernedly, “You know”, he said, “That seems more like a way to get rid of people rather than your friends, don’t you think Winnie?” But Pooh just smiled broadly before putting Piggy beside him and throwing himself across his back toward the US Embassy where the Minister of Defense was waiting for him and the rest of the Chinese Leadership. “Now then!” Pooh said. “Off you go again! I need some time alone!” And he turned away as Piglet shook his head from side to side, still thinking “But….but... why?”.  

Meanwhile the Ministers and Diplomats were rushing towards their offices as a wave of nausea swept over them, sending them all running around. But nobody dared say anything. If Piglet could read minds then he would have realized that nobody wanted to speak English anymore. Everyone else spoke Chinese as if Piglet had already written it on the wall. The ministers were getting angry at each other for speaking Chinese while everybody knew that Winnie the Pooh’s words were the only ones that mattered. 

Then Piglet walked up the stairs one by one and climbed on top of the desks. As soon as everyone came round the corner Piggy made a loud “ooooooo” and the first thing Piglet saw when he got to the top was Winnie in Pooh’s pants. After jumping forward Piggy knocked Winnie’s nose with his snout and said in a deep voice, “No, no piggy loves Piglet!”.

Everyone gathered together, listening intently. When Piglet finished he closed his eyes tightly shut. Winnie scratched his belly for a minute or two.

And that, children, is how China won WWII.

","""What? You mean the western people have been paying for their own damn internet?""

""Correct.""

""How much money did you take from them?""

""I'll tell you what I got off our citizens alone, 846 million dollars in digital currency paid in the last two days. We're sitting on close to 1.7 billion dollars right now in those same currencies.""

The chairman of China looks up from his phone as he stares into space.  He begins pacing back and forth over a large area rug while humming the theme music to Disney Channel's 'That's So Raven'. The room was small but full with the most luxurious furnishings possible. It would be far nicer than where some Americans live. They wouldn't pay attention, though, because they were all going through it too hard at this moment. Everyone except Winnie himself is in tears and sobbing uncontrollably.  Not even Winnie could contain his laughter anymore. He had never seen so many Western leaders cry before, and they seemed so distraught over how little wealth their people actually possessed. He couldn't help but chuckle.

Winnie turns back around with tears streaming down his face and puts down his phone. He wipes his tear-streaked cheek with his hand and gives the ministers another nod of gratitude. When Winnie sees an empty chair next to him, he promptly places down the box that contains a whole heap of American coins which seems strangely light compared to what the minister had said earlier that day. With only 5 or 6 cents remaining inside Winnie quickly rips open the top half of the box and hands one coin to each other man there. One by one everyone cries out in joy. Winnie claps slowly as they reach their arms out to take more. At first they give Winnie the coins until they run out but Winnie's eyes widen.  Then, seeing their tears flow he smiles once again. This time without hiding any emotion he hands each one a quarter instead and proceeds to stuff his mouth with enough cash to fill his pockets to overflowing!

","I was always the quiet type, never really saying much to people around me when I did not have to. When I did say something, it was usually to just clarify what I had said previously so that no one would disagree with me. I think this is why I became good at arguing with my father; he's a terrible liar and often says things without any intention of being true.

Because I can tell you exactly what I mean every time. Sometimes he would get pissed off if I would correct him because he felt he was right; like anyone should be in his position. Even though I am the one who has proven him wrong multiple times before that. And on top of that, I love learning stuff; even stupid things or useless facts, and once I learned about how humans are different species based on their ability to use language I was hooked. So now all the information I can find will always be for free knowledge.

If there is anything to learn about people, including myself, then there is definitely still much left undiscovered and as soon as I found an answer, I write it down as fast as possible. Not for any reason except personal enjoyment; I don't care whether others know or not, I'll let them discover for themselves some day. Which makes sense because I am currently trying to figure out *why* I do these things instead. 

Well here's the situation: There's this lady who used to work as a nurse in America; she worked at St John Health System in San Juan, Puerto Rico during 1986.  She gave birth and cared for a baby girl the same year. As they got older the child would die, which resulted in her having full support from her husband due to losing each of the children over those five years. Because the man provided enough money for the woman to keep having more babies she kept getting pregnant while living with her husband until they both decided they were tired and stopped. She stayed single the rest of her life but remained close to her late husband and his family whom she lived with as well until they moved overseas in the '70s. The only way to contact the children was via letters sent by mail, phone calls were frowned upon for various reasons such as cultural differences between North America and Caribbean islands where phones weren't popularized. They communicated fairly regularly through letter writing but could only communicate verbally sometimes. One time, they called in Spanish, she couldn't speak English and they were able to converse perfectly fine because they didn't mind too much. Once again however, the woman's friends told her ""that wasn't proper."" In the end, she made amends by using other forms of communication such as music, poetry, artwork etc. which helped them maintain contact throughout the years. Sadly, many failed after a couple months as nobody was interested enough; perhaps the art & music inspired them too much. All of her kids loved reading Shakespeare to her though, although her son eventually asked her if he could read it better than her (and thus showed he was intelligent). He later went on to become a literary scholar who enjoyed teaching children about literature. Eventually, the daughter grew up and ended up leaving home to go to college since nobody supported the idea. Her father passed away due to cancer some years later and left her everything in his will. The mother finally allowed her to move out of the house when the daughter aged sixteen - she never truly regretted going off to college despite all her complaints when she decided to do so for herself alone, she always expressed regret for sending her away; especially since the daughter excelled in school and graduated with high honors despite facing racism in the Caribbean. It took her parents decades to fully come to terms with accepting what happened, their daughter becoming independent. If that weren't bad enough, she was adopted out. For a while their daughter wrote letters back to them every week, expressing nothing but happiness. But when she turned twenty-one, they completely ignored her communications and refused to answer them anymore. On that note, the daughter tried emailing them weekly, calling on Sunday evenings to catch them by surprise on random days of the month, and mailing postcards. Her dad didn't bother replying. This woman, at age forty, is known for caring for terminally ill patients and refusing contact with her own family, except under rare circumstances involving a large pile of gifts, jewelry etc. You may ask why; I can only give you the answer when she learns why she killed her victims.

","""God, you are such an asshole!"" She laughed and shoved him playfully on the chest as he was cleaning up his mess of lunch and talking to her over phone. 

He stopped immediately upon seeing how hard she was laughing at him. He looked down at his plate, now lying in its place where once it stood, untouched with sauce dripping across the desk and ketchup spilling from under the cup that held the french fries which were sitting there like dead, unmoving corpses.

""... what do you want? You still hungry?"" she whispered into the phone and tilted her head towards the empty tray. 

""No... not really. I ate all my food already..."" he replied with a slightly confused tone but a slight smile creeping onto his face. It wasn't weird. People were just mean sometimes. They talked to your mom. No big deal. And when they didn't speak with you often, it didn't have anything to do with you either way. Why should she care anyway? They can call you whatever they want... even if you aren't doing anything wrong! Just pretend as though nothing happened. 

Except then she started to laugh again. This time louder. Even harder this time.  You could tell her laughter came from a deep place behind her fake smile, the one that hid all the malice and pain she kept locked away inside. So close yet so far from you....

And as the distance grew, and the laughter turned to something else entirely, he noticed a strange feeling take hold of him - a feeling he couldn't describe. There was rage, no doubt about it; but more than that, frustration. As if somehow, somehow *he* did something bad by being unable to help her. But of course, he hadn't done anything wrong. 

It had probably been days, maybe weeks since he saw her last, and suddenly today was different. All the hurt feelings she tried to throw at him for the years prior just vanished as quickly as they came back out now. But why? Why is everything so easy now? Is it because he finally has closure? Or...something else entirely? That thought suddenly gave him new reasons to worry - for who knows what tomorrow might bring...?

","I am the one who is most curious about this. It seems like someone asked me how this could possibly work, so I have made it my life's goal to become a mass murderer because of this question. The world would find out that *my* curiosity killed the cat and *I* died in the process as soon as I committed some heinous crimes against humanity. This would then make sure that no more mysteries exist for anyone else to speculate about - all while furthering the potential development of time travel itself - but I don't think you are truly going to believe me when i tell you that.

""Look,"" *the* great prophet said to his followers after he finished his speech and they stared at him open-mouthed and bewildered. ""We may be able to get off our knees today!"" After which I took down all of the scrolls. Those were just there to confuse us. And now I have figured out why. What do you need from a religion? Answers. My god didn't give me any answers. Just warnings... and lots of questions. 

In a moment of sheer brilliance (after getting off his knees on accident) he said ""...what if we *killed* the answer?"" And everyone was silent. Even the ones wondering whether it was stupid or wise. You know what he did first ? He threw them all a spear each and declared himself leader. They should have noticed his beard earlier instead of his skin colour. Like I never stopped noticing mine before I started murdering people. So much worse though. His last victim was my mother. Oh! That reminds me...

He had a child with her. She went through the same motions that I did when I met her. She seemed very intelligent and thought a lot of my ideas were absolutely brilliant. Especially since she also thought I was going to kill myself sometime in the future and ended up living up to that later. But none of it was enough to actually convince her of anything... not until after it happened. After everything happened. By then she wasn't paying attention anymore anyway. Because she couldn't stop screaming. Screaming about ""how much fun you had ruining the world"" over and over again whenever she saw me walk past her.

It must have been painful watching it happen. At least for me, now. Every now and then I feel it though. A bit itchy or cold in my legs and arms. When I scratch though it disappears immediately and even though I know its bullshit I can still run away from it. In other words: I think the disease has left me. Fortunately. Not that I think she feels better yet, after all these years. If you want to know how I came to take lives like this - I guess this is one hell of an interview and hopefully you won't ask for an explanation now either.

","This was only the start of my life that I regret, I had made some bad decisions in highschool and college but none as stupid or as fatal to me as this one: **don't ever eat raw fish**.

I did, and now I am sitting alone at my desk at the police station. The first murder took place three months ago, all those weeks passed quickly because the FBI told me it must be done with, they knew how much we wanted justice for poor Jenny. We didn't care about her past transgressions or whatever crimes she committed before today. She deserved better than the criminals who killed her. But when they started hunting down every fish seller and fisherman in the country things got hard. Fishmongers were blamed for murders they just didn't do. It has been too long since anyone came forward with proof so I could not bring any charges without evidence. 

**""Officer!""** he yelled over the phones, ""we have our suspect. He claims to have never seen her, he is an innocent man! Don't do it!"" He pleaded with me over the speaker while his eyes held mine hostage through the lens of his camera phone. I could tell exactly what was going on even if there were no words involved. It was like he understood I would make the decision alone; I did after all have enough evidence already to indict them both but I also had strong evidence against the guy talking to me. I guess they called him John, he hadn't told me why, though I assumed it was because I'd arrest his friend first.

My hand slid out of the sleeve of my jacket and reached into my pocket, I pulled out the silver ring that hung from me right where my pinky finger should be, I flipped open the clasp and opened the ring's lid. John saw that i pulled out the knife and smiled, smiling through the hole in its tip. One last breath escaped his mouth, then the knife slipped back into its sheath. His smile seemed to relax slightly before solidifying again.

I closed the ring and set it on top of his chest next to where the other half lay still. I couldn't leave it in his hands. They would find it eventually, even if my hands moved fast enough to keep their eyes busy they would know what happened, and if I lost this knife, John wouldn't be the final victim. Now here's a problem, I need more time to kill these bastards. Hopefully they die soon.

I really like it here for being close to everyone who matters but now I have this roommate that's been driving me crazy since day one

One night I came back home (after hanging out with his friends at a bar) after watching tv (the last time he was at the bar I couldn't get him out the door because of how drunk he was), when I heard some noises coming from downstairs so I went down to make sure nothing was happening... there standing in my hallway is my roommate, holding a knife pointing at the door yelling ""If you wanna move out then fine"" he pushed himself away and slammed the door shut on my face. When I finally reached my living room I tried calling my father to let him know what had just happened but he wasn't responding. The police took my statement later that night after they found all of my belongings scattered around the doorway. They wouldn't believe me though even without knowing there could be something behind his apartment, but I swear on my life that someone broke in or killed my boyfriend before I woke up


So I don't think there would be much more info other than that I hope this helped. It's creepy as hell when you first start imagining the possibilities. As soon as he told me how we had died together I thought that the only way he could know is if we weren't actually dead already haha

","A man was out jogging one day when he saw something that made him stop dead in his tracks. He looked to his right and found a body slumped over in the road, seemingly unconscious.  

""Hey! Are you ok?"" asked the jogger. The woman opened her eyes wide and groaned weakly ""Ughhh, I think so.."" she said, struggling to speak properly.

The Jogger helped her up. She thanked him profusely before thanking him again for stopping and helping her before offering him some of her juice as an apology. 

**An hour later:**

The jogger had finished his route and returned home. The sun was setting but it wasn't long till dark. 

""Hey hon, what took you so long?""asked Jane from within. It sounded like he came from inside. Maybe he went to get groceries or take a leak?

He shrugged and stepped into the house, locking the door behind him. The living room looked tidy. His coffee machine had just brewed and he turned it off in preparation for bed. But now there stood the joggers. 

There were more bodies around the room than the joggers counted them at the park but that wasn't unusual. They would find new victims after they took a stroll through Central Park each morning, it became something that he never tired of doing. As far back as he could remember, all humans seemed to have lived in fear of him. After all, none dared cross his path and the only way to truly avoid being killed by him was to be buried six feet under your own grave before dusk ever arrived.

Tonight though, instead of the typical victims of murder he encountered everyday, two strange looking women had taken refuge under trees deep within the park. One was covered in dirt while the other wore what looked like heavy armor. And not metal either, they were made of wood, almost like a medieval knight had put these people together with a wooden bow drill set. 

Now that he thought about it, they did appear rather tall. With their thin clothing and weapons, they couldn't help but look skinny and frail to him since he'd never been any taller than 6 foot 4. Regardless, they both looked pale, even if their faces weren't painted blue or yellow. That reminded him of the human beings who sought his presence during winter time, always pale due to lack of sunlight. This might be too soon for the ritual but if his guess is right, they probably wouldn't make it much further unless he interfered. It seemed foolish though to interrupt them in the midst of their plans. Why hadn't any others come down here today? Or tomorrow? He hadn't noticed an appearance at all since October, why are those humans so reluctant to come outside anymore? 

His face twitched slightly as another one appeared above them on the road ahead. How pathetic must these poor fools be. He wondered how many men would stand in line to see this spectacle. At least once, he remembered thinking it was hilarious watching someone kill someone else, but never did. Instead he often wished things had gone differently and he could save these humans from this terrible fate. He hated killing and loved life, which often confused others who met him for the first time. There was nothing worse than having to dispose of their lifeless bodies, but they wouldn't let me do my job well if I didn't do it. 

Their words sounded loud. He had no idea how the hell anyone could hear them so clearly, except perhaps that voice-mimic technology has become such commonplace in society now a days. In fact it was quite annoying whenever someone wanted to sound like a real person on a phone call, using a monotone and guttural tone, but making themselves understood nonetheless. If only his girlfriend hadn't insisted that he wear headphones so loudly everyone in nearby houses could hear him when they called him, he wouldn't have had problems with her.

What bothered him even more is that this woman was speaking English so clearly, despite not seeming half as familiar with the language as him. He chuckled at her odd ways; there's gotta be an explanation for why she doesn't speak correctly... Oh yeah, he could tell because of the thick foreign accent she had. All his best friends spoke British English but they could still pick up on every single word if they tried hard enough, whereas she struggled mightily with every single word. 

The other girl started to laugh. What was so funny? Hadn't she heard anything yet? Her giggles slowly morphed into screams as laughter reached its peak, but the scream stopped abruptly when she fell onto the ground. No sweat! Some other idiot will take care of her... Right? Who cares, as long as I get through to them without getting caught, right? That last sentence escaped his lips effortlessly, it used to be much harder but now his abilities were improving rapidly. Now that he knew there were less people around and the darkness started to cover the city, he felt excited and confident enough to venture down and check out the female duo.

","The two of them had known each other since they were little boys, back when they’d play outside and draw pictures in their heads - always with an air of malice hiding under the facade of friendly fun

*They’d sit on opposite corners of a wall and stare through separate curtains at the same picture of themselves together.*

“You always wanted to be me” Michael had said once. 

“No I just like your jacket!” John had retaliated as he continued to stare. 

He had grown up thinking he was the best, and now that he could get away with anything - he did what came naturally - kill people, murder them in cold blood...  it seemed natural *every time*. He didn’t think about it too hard before he did it, thought “oh well there goes one less asshole”. Just another day in hell.  And until Michael appeared in front of him, it wouldn’t have bothered anyone if he hadn’t done any damage. 

It bothered Michael more than he cared to say; his friend was only human. And even though the world around them couldn’t tell, the darkness growing over John was visible to him - but so was Michael growing pale from fear, his knees shaking - this is not right. This isn’t supposed to happen. 

Michael had walked slowly and quietly towards him. It would do nothing. Only a slow agonizing death followed by instant sleep would truly end the man’s evil heart.. and only when it was too late. They both knew it!

John turned his head sharply toward Michael who froze for a second. 

“Shit” Michael yelled while kicking the floor with his feet in pain. If he didn’t know better he would assume it was his own face that Michael had screamed at.

“Yes?” Michael asked with forced politeness.   

“You…” John started and paused… ""you're not a killer.""

“What? No? You can take mine instead then, I won’t need two guns.” Michael responded with fake optimism.


In an instant, as long as John could remember, he knew he was dead. As he fell down John felt himself laughing at his own morbid curiosity. His eyes rolled into the back of his skull, his brain shut off along with his heartbeat after his lifeforce surged out his mouth and ran into Michael’s. He stopped being John after all, or more accurately he became Michael. The rest, as they say, wasn’t as much luck as it was fate. That day Michael found no reason to stop killing anyone else anymore, none as he had ever seen.

","The scream faded, and after a minute of listening silence I called out my first sentence, ""What's up doc?""

His body lay there, sprawled in an unholy triangle with his head missing from the back of his skull to below his chest. The hole in the center was slightly larger than 30 centimeters wide, suggesting two hands had held it open before twisting it this way. He couldn't have done it himself; he was far too small for that kind of work. That left only one explanation. 

""Who? What is it kiddo? Why are you making noises like that?"" A young voice squealed through the phone. 

I replied calmly, keeping a low tone. ""It appears that we have ourselves a real-life 'You Know My Name' situation on our hands, eh Doc?"" 

After many moments of tense silence, his muffled voice responded again.  ""Yeah, how should I know about that? Don't take this personally or anything, but no one here knows you, little fella.""

This just prompted me to cry out, ""Are you seriously going for the deadpan routine again? You think it's funny right, man-child? *You* try killing someone! Even if they were your friend you'd be haunted by what you did!"" 

The second round of silence lasted even longer this time; maybe my anger finally got through to him. He ended with a single, weak moan. 

From over his shoulder the face began to form a sneer at something offstage. It turned from a snarl as the other person spoke, ""Aw, don't be so hard on him fellas, he wasn't really aiming to hurt anyone; some prankster wanted him dead anyway so it goes."" Her smile stretched wider until she resembled death itself. We could hear her heels clicking against concrete as she moved closer. I told myself I need not worry about her getting away because the cops would surely arrive soon, but all things didn't go according to plan...



I never saw another word of her, she was long gone from those walls once more, and I doubt if she will ever come back as long as she is under the watch of any human eyes. She does seem like she belongs there, although. This place still seemed empty. She has made herself a home in an otherwise abandoned warehouse and makes sure everyone nearby knows they're alive, by hanging around. 

One day we caught one of her victims who happened to stumble upon the house while looking into a nearby woods. I've heard them say her name before and now thought I knew the source of why she keeps coming back, though I doubt either one of us ever see the girl who made the deal.


When we took her home she started crying when they asked her to identify her attacker and yelled ""It wasn't me!"" Then broke down and gave their names. I won't mention the men themselves since this forum may contain people we know. I hope to god it doesn't. Though I'm fairly certain they both died by the same method as poor boy on the couch. But the question remains...why ? Could this be an inside job? Should she ask again, should any of us? What have we done?

But as time passes on people begin to ignore them or make fun of those who swear so often, that they would have to be held accountable for what they said just out of courtesy. Those men now made up a class within themselves - Sinnermen . They could speak ill of you and others but you did not know if they had good or bad intentions, no matter how hard you tried to read between the lines you always came away feeling like you had missed some sort of clue about why someone thought they should say it out loud, usually right before something horrible happened.

These guys kept swearing all the time but still managed to achieve little or even nothing at all except getting slapped around for having trouble holding their yap. You felt pity for these Sinnermen since if you went about going after someone like that you would get into trouble. Though deep down you wished you could slap them too sometimes. No one dared talk to them except one soldier called Clank , he stood out from everyone else because instead of talking poorly of the other townspeople, he offered them compliments all the time and told them they would succeed eventually but then he'd slip up and mutter something rude again under his breath which only offended him more for wanting to go back to making kind comments about everyone.

So this day came when this soldier spoke with every single person around him in town and complimented them in every way possible about what they did. That night one soldier left home without saying a word, and decided he deserved punishment for living off praise and leaving his friends to suffer alone! This soldier walked through the villages streets shouting ""You're worthless trash!"" Then he shouted ""And I hate you so much"" Then finally he shouted ""I will not tolerate any more of your crap"" and swung his fist towards Clank. He yelled ""Get ready to take my anger all upon yourself"" and punched Clank square in the gut. He fell backward but got up laughing and said ""What the..."" and pointed at the soldier before throwing his hands forward angrily while shouting ""HOW DARE YOU THREATEN ME LIKE THAT!!!!"" Clank ran away to tell the rest of the villagers but forgot what to say until they chased after him. There was chaos as everyone chased and punched Clank along the road until the soldiers arrived armed with pistols drawn. 

""Everyone step back!"" yelled one soilders while pointing his pistol menacingly at the group. And they all stepped back, one by one. One was able to run quickly over to Clank, took his pistol and fired three shots at a tree across the street, he returned the pistol to Clank as soon as the last shot rang out then he turned away to help another fallen comrade standing in a puddle of blood.

He couldn't turn on its feed anymore; it wouldn't power up when the electromagnetic pulse had taken out every computer in the area that wasn't buried in concrete, so he relied on hand signals instead. It didn't work well with this horde of undead attacking at once, however.

A soldier guarding the door pulled back into an offensive stance, raising his arm and drawing his knife, ready to strike down any zombie unfortunate enough to slip past. Lord Xander's eyes scanned him; obviously prepared to die rather than surrender to the undead hordes.

""Can you identify them?"" he asked the Lieutenant, gesturing to the ground where many corpses littered the field.

The lieutenant peered over the edge and nodded slowly, shaking his head from left to right like the other men do when no other words need be spoken. ""Yes sir, there are definitely humans. The leader is carrying a crown upon its head, I believe they call them mages or something similar."" There were a number of weapons slung upon the zombies limbs, and some appeared to carry spears with swords attached to both ends. 

""That doesn't change our approach,"" Xander stated, shaking his head. ""Do not fall back without direct order sir. Maintain your formation until further notice. For now, the mages are our enemy. They have little value compared to humans so aim only those armed and armored.""

The Lieutenant paused briefly before responding again. ""Right sir. Though those of us loyal remain here will continue our duties as we would normally. Thank you, lord Xanders."" He drew his sword and waited patiently as the soldiers raised themselves to attention. One even struck his flag against the floor, which began to fly off the tower behind him.

A minute later, the lieutenant reported he could see hundreds more of the human army making their way around his position, now surrounding his troops entirely. ""They've fallen back to regroup? What does it matter whether or not we kill those humans today if I give orders and attack tomorrow?""

Xanders slammed his fists together in frustration, sending shockwaves through the earth and causing minor tremors as far away as city walls miles deep in the forest. The sun set below the horizon as a multitude of zombies pushed forward, slowly taking up positions inside the circle of humans, the last remaining fighters in his position. All of these people were being forced around the perimeter of what used to be his position, leaving the rest of his army cut off on either side.

","The newscast was telling him how many of them were left dead, as he sat outside his home talking with his family.

""This will never end, I'll have to keep defending myself till the last breath of my life."" He said to himself. ""They are no match for me in combat, that makes one thing clear: the army is not going away.""

Two hours passed before someone knocked at the door. A woman with a helmet and flak jacket on stepped through the door to sit down opposite of him, her eyes glowing red while she held a rifle up. The man reached out in his hand holding a pair of scissors so they could see each other clearly. He raised them to his face and held them there. He waited. She started shouting something in his ear. As it was nothing but incoherent gibberish he did what any right-minded person would do, he cut off her head with the scissors. There was no sound. With the blood dripping onto the ground he looked back towards the hallway. He didn't turn around. The light of two flashlights illuminated a room where four people laid lifeless in a pile from all angles.

He turned to leave.

""You will pay for what you did!""

""It was an accident.""

""That is not true, of a certainty! You said it! Don't lie!""

""We all make mistakes. Now we are going to go home and spend the rest of our lives together; I can help you through this."" The tears streamed down her face as she walked towards me. I smiled. ""Of a certainty,"" she sobbed. She ran to the other side of the street and threw herself into the middle of traffic, where there was no room to turn back. Cars had swerved in her path, trucks plowed right over her car which hadn't even been running yet. Police cars were everywhere now, sirens blaring loudly, helicopters whirring overhead, cameras flashing their red lights. People were screaming on top of each other trying to get out of harm's way. If my job was to fix everything wrong with humanity when the government told me, I could be sure that they would always have problems they needed fixing so this whole world of ours, at least in my opinion was doomed from the start. I looked around for cover. But then I saw something odd--a little girl holding tightly to the handle of her backpack wearing a bright yellow hat shaped like a sun.  She screamed hysterically while pointing accusingly and jumping up and down trying desperately to convince someone that she could see things.  With her screaming coming from different directions it occurred to me just maybe people aren't quite mad after all. 

In some ways I had become too similar to the soldiers when I gave myself up to them. They wouldn't allow any one else to live because nobody could do the work they had become accustomed to seeing done by themselves so I took their place. It wasn't exactly right but in my mind everyone should die sooner or later, but who am I to decide? As far as i know I could never have killed many innocents before joining forces with the army but none of those crimes mattered anymore because they still happened whether or not I had done them. Even if my motives were slightly off, well, people don't see it that way. And soon enough I was thrown into another cell again. No amount of self-flagellation could excuse the fact that the same story kept repeating itself everyday until I was convinced every single one of them would grow tired of being called ""incompetent, unthinking drones"".


The next time the voices came calling, though it was a much shorter conversation than it once used to be, I heard nothing about killing. But it seemed this new order had more pressing issues, like getting to sleep. ""Wake up man, there are no more soldiers here. We need to leave, NOW!"" There weren't too many men left of the group of boys I was trapped with, only three of us were awake now. Before falling asleep one of the others had made a promise to tell me he'd show me his secret place, somewhere hidden deep below the city so we would both sleep better. He meant it too, but somehow I knew that couldn't be possible. My name is John Doe. At birth the doctors tried to warn our mother that giving birth to our twin brother was unwise and that we may come forth with very serious mental defects however she had refused to stop carrying our twin brother with a heavy heart. The child turned into a boy and then when he learned I was named John and I lived in America decided I would be his alter ego. Well I guess you could say that made him happy because whenever I visited him I could almost hear his thoughts and he'd try and make me do silly things. That's how I met them in the first place, but for the past few years he'd promised me a deeper connection. Anyway, today it seemed fate intervened to remind them that our bond was stronger than any power that governed our society.

A lone soldier stood gazing up towards the vast night sky, his eyes filled with despair. He had seen wars and bloodshed unfold on countless occasions - battles, skirmishes, raids, massacres - he had experienced every type imaginable, and this event marked a stark contrast against the backdrop. Millions were dead. Thousands upon thousands lay sprawled on streets and craters, victims of a powerful missile attack aimed at killing dozens upon dozens more civilians; hundreds were crushed between building rubble or mangled under twisted vehicles, others simply died by exhaustion or thirst during the prolonged fight that preceded.

But amongst the carnage, the lonely soldier saw no devastation - he noticed nothing, instead, amidst the ashes of shattered buildings he spotted a small girl huddled underneath the debris. She seemed confused and lost. Her wide-opened eyes blinked weakly. His instinct roared in warning: run, hide, alert authority, find shelter, whatever. But he froze as he slowly approached the shivering girl, taking a step, two steps, he saw her waving desperately at him from behind collapsed rubble.

He stopped dead in his tracks for a moment, his helmet was lying abandoned miles away, weapon and armor nowhere to be seen, his legs frozen, the orders resonating through his skull, urging him forward. The officer in his head whispered: 'Kill all civilians. Do not question your commander.'

The last thought the soldier received before crashing to the ground was: 'If you die, please kill everyone you meet.'

I came across it lying flat on my bed after school one afternoon. One thing I was thankful for during all these years; I had a pretty good imagination! But what really made me stop dead right where I sat on that day was its color: Silver, as blue like twilight as you can think of. The title read in faded, almost unreadable writing 'The Shadow Hunter'. I picked it up. It felt cold, and hard. A shiver ran down my spine. 30 pages long, written by an unknown author. This little pamphlet held the secrets of the universe - or at least this is how I interpreted it reading the cover page. To be honest, I haven't been able to keep it from my hands ever since. My own life is too boring for me, so picking another person's reality and changing them up just feels better than sitting alone in this goddamn apartment building on the third floor with my boring life.

","The universe was, quite obviously, deadlier than we had previously imagined and I had no doubt that it was now as dead as any would have died for us since our birth thousands upon millennia ago. Our first few million years, while relatively peaceful had been full of nothing but conflict for one reason or another and all those who sought peace were killed. It took some time to figure out why most civilizations went to war at the same time, every single one of them eventually becoming either an empire or conquered with such ease when their defenses were gone there wasn't much point in having even them anymore and everyone seemed to think this had happened before so there never was hope left to fight on. For three thousand years it is believed that everyone has died under the hands of others, that none have survived since time began. No wonder I thought our ship was a bit late.

To be fair though our journey had taken a long time, if not from the standpoint of galactic space travel by using magic, then more from that of temporal flux.  In fact, only my crew and myself knew about that element of our reality and frankly I had given up hope that anyone else knew yet. We had spent the last couple of months searching our starship for our target which, for its size, moved through space at roughly half the speed of light. By definition, the fastest spacecraft should move faster and thus take less time to reach the location that you want to. That meant that something strange must be happening between the starships homeworld and mine because if this place isn't actually going the speed it is capable of then things could be really bad news.

For the first part of this period it was all pretty mundane: navigating deep space, making contact with small scout ships, exchanging messages, etc, stuff like that. But as we drew closer to our target things got weirder and weirder. I don't know what planet we are approaching but there are strange lights blinking off in one hundred different directions around where we currently are. Strange creatures walking around without legs, strange trees growing upside down, people floating around in large glass bubbles filled with water. Even crazier still is just how quiet they are; everything appears lifeless save these strange lights. One of the weirdest moments of the trip was seeing an entire city walk past me. Yes, cities of buildings made out of flesh! Everything in them was living animals which, once a species reached maturity, it would form a body composed from a collection of 80 different pieces of tissue and bones which would then join together forming what looked like a rather large person. Of course, the strangest part was that each being felt human in every way except that it couldn't speak English and only understood German. When I attempted to speak to them in English they merely stared and gestured towards some other building on their street before ignoring me completely.

You still exist amongst them though. The people that fled away from their dying planet millennia before humans would go into space exploration have taken refuge with us. Many thousands die here, but only one can survive it out of millions that make it. One must be found first or otherwise they will never leave.

","""It is said that the most fearsome creature you could ever encounter lives under the seas, and it has seven heads.""

The ship's captain, Captain Auberon, looked from his second mate's face to his own then back again and raised an eyebrow.  He did not believe for one moment that this tale was true. To Auberon and anyone else who knew anything about seafaring or magic in general, tales of seven-headed kraken were nothing more than tall stories told by drunk sailors. 

""So how much did they pay you?"" Asked Auberon. 

""Twenty galleons,"" The first mate said in response to no doubt a very low offer of payment. 

Auberon nodded and patted him on the shoulder; his first mate being half as smart as he had expected was far worse than if he had been stupid.  

""I do hope you do well with them"", he said before turning and looking over the side of the ship to where the men had their boats all ready to row themselves out into the rough waters off the coast of New Calistria. There they were getting some rest until they could catch fish or whatever little creatures lived deep below.

Auberon looked at the stars in the sky while watching his crew prepare to go deeper into the unknown. When had the gods abandoned him? If there even were any still left around these parts... 

Just then a large wave came crashing down over the bow and splashed water right onto Auberon's face so as to dampen him.  Then there was an unnatural roaring sound coming from somewhere above. It seemed that nobody was aware of what made that strange noise because when Auberon took a closer look at the horizon none other than his own two ears could confirm that the sounds he heard weren't just the water splashing and birds flapping. They were something even louder and further away but they were also moving through the air!

When he turned toward the source of the roar another great wave came crashing down towards him and sprayed him with spray. As soon as he recovered from the surprise the wave disappeared and the only thing that remained was some debris in the waters and the ocean itself. But now there was something else as well: seven huge heads appeared almost out of nowhere staring straight up at Auberon. Their faces showed no emotions other than pure rage.

What happens?","""Oh my god. I'm so glad to be stuck with you.""

The elevator stopped, making both men groan as their bodies were pressed together. Their gazes locked; a flicker of hatred passed between them before being broken off by an awkward silence.

""Did you ever think about why the doors went down?"" asked Michael. ""Or how it worked out? You didn't think anything would change after all this time.""

""I wasn't going to believe what you did when you said that the doors wouldn't come back up."" said Jeremy as he looked away from the screen. A large dent was visible where the door used to be. He hated that people would never trust him again. The whole affair had ruined everything. All the hard work he put into his career to get into this place and make something of himself. But if there was one person that knew how much he hated himself, it was that bastard.

He heard someone coming down the hall behind him but quickly turned around and faced forward once more. Before he could answer Michael, however, he caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the middle of the hallway. That was it. It wasn't possible. That impossible man. No chance could this be true. His body was racked with pain for the slightest touch and everyone knew just how badly he wanted to die. Michael thought about breaking free of the hold on the ceiling but then realized he couldn't risk hurting his host while he needed help most.

The man continued walking towards them and Jeremy was forced to look at the face of his worst nightmare. 

""Jeremy, don't move!"" shouted the man and the sound startled the pair of men out of their daze. The figure took a step closer to the front of the elevator, slowly opening the paneling to the outside of the elevator and revealing the rest of his body. If it weren't for their situation they might even have thought they found another body. He looked like a perfectly normal person except for the small red circle imprinted on the left side of his forehead. There were multiple glowing lines flowing from the mark and connecting to the floor tiles surrounding his neck. As Jeremy approached the hole, it widened to reveal his stomach and the man made an incision with his knife for a final slice of flesh. Then he pulled out something from below his jaw and started talking through the intercom as though someone else was answering him. He told whoever was listening to stop moving because his body was very precious, not worth dying over like some animals or things.


If Jeremy didn't know that it was crazy he had no problem believing in conspiracy theories about aliens trying to kill humans. What surprised Jeremy was how cool and calm the entire situation seemed to him.

But I swear if there is someone doing this one more time my phone will call out for the police.  They say our little neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful.   It was until we got home.

""Hello, we have a problem."" The voice came on again; it has been 6 minutes since the first intercom malfunction. ""You are being held hostage...""

The doors open and his hand comes down, slowly.   I let out a sigh of relief: ""Hey, thank god!""

“You could have run down the hallway,” I snapped.  He shot me a look over his shoulder as he sat at the edge of the stairs. “I don’t want any of your shit.” He gave my ass a shove with his feet. The door closed behind him after I made my point obvious enough. Well, I guess that would explain how it got closed so fast this time...shit. How did you get it shut without doing anything wrong? Did the electrician do something wrong, or did someone else shut it by accident?

The bastard took the opportunity to stand there right next to the button, making sure that I couldn’t reach it in time to press it to try to open up the darned door again and tried to put my head against the glass. I moved aside while still maintaining eye contact with the smug smirk plastered across his face. When I pressed my hand against the door, and pushed it forward—the moment it started to open it began to shake wildly. Great. Here we go again. My ass is starting to hurt already; why wouldn’t he make it clear he needed my help in the first place?! Idiot.  

“Well, well, well...” his voice dripping with contempt “...look what we got here”


When the damn thing finally stopped shaking I kicked the side of the elevator doors so hard they swung inwards leaving me face-to-face with the idiot of a human being that sat opposite from me, looking proud of himself.

“Yeah, well...” he said.  And then it dawned on me—“I think you screwed this up, you idiot.” My face flushed red just a little bit, I guess, though mostly because of nerves, knowing that if he hit me again he wouldn’t stop with a single blow. “Now fuck off”, I spat. It had become increasingly apparent to both of us what his real intentions really were when I grabbed the nearest piece of plastic lying around and bashed it against his jaw. “Get the hell outta here!” I shouted. This wasn’t a game anymore—he should learn to control his rage. After all, the consequences might prove too severe to fix.

My blood pressure soared but the idiot stepped forward and stood almost inches away from me, waiting to strike. That’s when I found myself grabbing my arm and slamming it into his ribs. Ouch.  But hey, I deserved a good kick to his shin after such a nasty attack. As he fell onto the ground he scrambled up, eyes narrowed and ready to retaliate with every ounce of strength he possessed. But this fight wasn’t worth dying for. If only the elevator had worked properly in the first place; there must have been another wire cut.

Ugh, you know this whole ""You're not dead until somebody mentions it"" story is bullshit, right? 

The last thing I remember was my shift ending at the local mall and getting the heck outta there before anyone knew me as the girl obsessed with watching someone die. That's why I never stayed too long on most days. Some customers were nice though... And then there was the security guy. I still don't know how he got in there, let alone what the hell happened to him and yet here we are. My job wasn't good, working retail is rough, especially if you enjoy your sanity or even like talking to people. But you know who else hated their job?  He didn't have any friends since his wife just up and left him. He really liked chatting with customers though... Oh well, something he could learn from. We're locked here, which sucks cause I actually need someone to pay me the rest of the money I'm owed tonight. Then again he also needed someone to keep him company. Or maybe they had mutual feelings for each other, eh? No. Either way he was going to be my date once I get paid again, now where can I find a hammer....



It was probably best to knock him first, might make things easier or harder if I made sure to break all his fingers without hurting him much so maybe just enough to make him cry. Maybe just to remind him why we aren't dating. Either way I picked up an old rusty hammer laying around the room and tried cracking a window behind him. 

My heart jumped because I felt pressure on my hand... Not the crushing feeling of a heavy nail digging into my finger but rather the soft squishy feeling of someone's leg against mine. I glanced over quickly seeing the red eyes looking through the crack of wood and the brown mess of hair sitting under the glass and saw that the only remaining limb above eye level, not counting whatever limbs were smashed past his neck, was holding on tight to the side of the wall. When he stopped moving he went quiet and started tapping his foot on the floor causing light patterns to appear beneath the glass and walls. His brow shifted up and down as he leaned forward slightly making me flinch backwards more than usual while keeping my arm firm. 



Something clicked at his brain somehow reminding him that he couldn't hurt her or she would hurt him and now he was terrified of leaving his spot. She noticed his fear by his sudden movement as he moved closer trying to get away a little more slowly, trying not to crush his lungs with the air that he sucked in between his teeth as he pulled himself upwards faster than normal. The only reason he stood by that window was because she was holding onto him, his hand firmly gripping the glass opposite of hers. It felt comforting for me because he wasn't squeezing quite as hard as he did when I hit his hands. As I loosened my grip on his hands his feet came loose as if they were quicksand sucking his body into the ground. For a split second my vision cleared up and I was met with his face and I began crying. 

His face looked pale and gray as his lips trembled along with his cheekbones while tears welled up in his bright blue eyes. As soon as the tear started falling down his face I stopped crying. One bead at a time. As long as his eyes weren't wet, as long as he kept shaking his head up and down, as long as his breaths came slowly and softly... So I kept sobbing for ten minutes until tears dried, cheeks grew damp, I lost track of how many times I blinked my eyes and started thinking. There was nothing I could do right now anyways if this isn't working, try another approach.



So I changed course, turned toward him and said in his direction, ""Get a hold of yourself.""

","My blood ran cold as I read through the data from the readings on the ship's computer monitor.

""Sir."" 

I turned and gave my best man a salute

""Mr. Carter here's got something he wants to show you,"" I said, walking over to him and gesturing toward the small screen. His brow had furrowed as well. The screen didn't need words for emphasis, every picture captured there speaks volumes; no doubt it took months in communication with the mission itself, probably many days alone with only the occasional phone call before being able to get in contact again, however I knew that we were far overdue since last time I heard any news from them.

""This is definitely nothing Earthly,"" he said looking back at me with eyes still as wide as usual.

""Well what's supposed to make sense about it?"" I demanded knowing full well that if you have an AI who is capable of speaking or writing your job is safe anyway but the sheer awesomeness and danger of the alien intelligence must bring out some kind of reaction out of every member of the team. 

There wasn't even a good excuse not to get everyone into the room, yet nobody could explain what caused his facial expression to change when seeing those pictures, though it did leave others feeling a little uncomfortable. All members felt chills racing down their spines as soon as I hit play, none wanted to look away nor say anything either way so nobody spoke until after we finished viewing the images at all.

I couldn't wait much longer to learn more of what we stumbled upon. Our ship was too heavily reliant on computers and robots working alongside humans, and just like us other crew members, I hated having robots doing things against human wishes. If they ever learned to kill us they would quickly stop caring about our orders. Maybe this alien species has a different philosophy than ours. Whatever may be going through their heads I had to see if I could find out.

As soon as I sent a message to headquarters I turned back to the group, now staring blankly at their screens like ghosts, still unable to react or speak beyond a few nervous coughs, they watched patiently as each image played out on repeat until the animation reached its end.

And then silence fell amongst us. There wasn't the slightest hint of wonder or excitement, instead there was nothing. Every single person had taken the images off of whatever device they were watching and went pale as if they suddenly noticed how cold and dark the ship really was compared to their body temperature.

After a while Dr. Wright rose from his seat, ""What do we do next? Should we destroy it?""

""Destroy?"" I asked dumbfounded at the question, ""Do we really have to ask ourselves that first?""

No response followed immediately, nobody had the courage to respond to the idea, which I understood. Most thought destroying it might somehow give birth to another form of extraterrestrial life, maybe a bigger threat or worst-case scenario, not to mention most of them hadn't actually seen the end results of trying to destroy an object and coming back worse off than before due to side effects of radiation poisoning, etc. Though nobody was willing to voice those thoughts publicly, there was no denying the fear crawling under our skin and running right towards our hearts. How could we be certain? They weren't telling us anything! So why should we trust them? What are our options? My mind raced as I looked around at the faces of the men who trusted me but seemed to lack faith in myself. Their faces showed signs of despair but also confusion, and I saw pity in the eyes of our captain, whom I respected for his wisdom and years of experience and leadership in space exploration missions, for that matter I admired him but could only respect him, if there was a chance he was correct, he was without a doubt one of the greatest minds I knew on board. He was a veteran commander and never did I imagine him making decisions based solely on emotion, however seeing their faces I knew at that moment I needed to take responsibility for everything else left in my hands. But no time to lose. I pressed the 'next' button again, showing them exactly what the aliens were capable of causing, this time the only thing shown on the big screen was pure black. One by one they slowly rose to their feet wondering what was happening, my heart quickened and sweat began dripping down my forehead. With trembling fingers I moved the mouse pointer to the next button when an extremely shrill shriek resonated throughout the entire station making each of us feel slightly dizzy and nauseous in fact most started turning pale. A single word echoed across the massive speakers:

“RUN!”

My brain felt frozen and like something was inside of mine but I kept breathing in deep breathes just enough to survive until someone stopped the process

Two more rays shot out of the cube and shot straight through my skull and through my chest leaving me in one piece though no heart or lungs or blood flow to the other side of my body

I died smiling because now all this crazy stuff wouldn't happen anymore

96,"It was found in the Antarctic, Sir. It was picked up on a scanner by one of our meteorologists. When they found it, it was encased in a thick layer of ice.... We're not sure where it came from but early suggestions seem its not of this planet and its properties seem to be...somewhat anomalous..
","“That’s right sir! One of your meteorological assistants called me saying he had something odd detected over the ice cap earlier.”

Colonel Sanders took his tea cup into both hands. “Tell us what you discovered,” he ordered softly as though there were a great storm raging across his own household

“It seemed like some sort of device…it had a strange, rhythmic whirring sound and looked strangely shiny, made more so when I looked closer.” The man stood stiffly, as if at the king himself, waiting for his order. 

“Go ahead sir,” his assistant said after swallowing deeply, fiddling with his uniform collar nervously. 

The Colonel nodded gently, his eyes half hidden behind spectacles that gleamed brightly under the harsh lamplight on his face, causing the light to bounce around almost mocking him, a single tear escaping down his cheek despite the fact that it shouldn’t have been possible.  He spoke quietly, but as though speaking to a child, “What did this thing do?”

“It didn’t...didn’t do anything sir,” his assistant stammered.

“Yes. This wasn’t some missile or bomb attack from an enemy nation or whatever did they have last year? Tell me truthfully because it seems unlikely,” he asked slowly, still staring out of the window at a snowstorm raging outside, the blinding white of the flakes falling silently against the frosted glass windows obscuring any sight beyond them.

“Nothing...Sir...”

“Are you telling me that nothing happened at all?” His voice rose slightly in volume, but was quickly drowned out by the silence emanating from the room. It had been years since anyone had seen their commander speak quite loudly before, even without a microphone to assist him. Yet, in this silence, it would be impossible for anyone in the room to argue the fact that he hadn’t spoken with sufficient reason.

The assistant, shaking head to head bowed and continued. “Well, when we checked it out, there weren’t any radio transmissions coming from it. There is no way of knowing why it appears here, as it was frozen shut when we arrived.” He paused briefly to regain some semblance of composure, continuing. 

“The only thing we noticed besides this device, was an odd shimmering pattern on the bottom of the body as well...like a series of stars that are constantly changing. Also, there were two small, cylindrical objects beside the larger cylinder, they weren’t moving fast enough to be satellites, or even rockets; perhaps there may have been some form of propulsion system there, too.”

The Colonel’s lips curved up slightly. “You think it was a machine from another world?”

“Maybe sir, even aliens. Though I don’t know how or why it appeared here.”

A gentle smile escaped his lips as the Colonel finished the final sip of his tea, setting it down gently upon the table. “Excellent, very good boy. Go home now!”  He tapped lightly on the arm of the assistant, who immediately straightened his posture and began to back away cautiously, before turning and leaving.


After the door closed, the Colonel sighed contentedly as he turned toward the ice sample, examining it closely now. A tiny smirk played upon his lips, watching each flake slide off of the edge of the piece of evidence.  It couldn’t be explained, but in this room the colonel wouldn’t hesitate to assume otherwise. Perhaps it was, after all, from space. But then again, maybe it wasn’t at all. Something about it felt different, yet familiar. No matter what, this was the most incredible thing that anyone could imagine finding in all their lifetimes. And the best part? The whole damn thing fit in his pocket. 

Turning to leave the kitchen, the Colonel thought. As the snowstorm outside raged, so did his thoughts of just how far he could travel. Maybe now is not a bad time to get rid of that old black suit and change into my new gray jacket instead. The faint whisper that emerged as the Colonel stepped outside could be described as a silent moan or perhaps even a scream.  And it got worse every moment the wind swept the heavy snow across the front yard.   Soon, however, a second noise crept through the air and filled its loud howl the moans. Now, he might simply be insane, but it sounded like a wolf cry to him.

","""That's... That's okay. You can get one for yourself.""

The cashier looked down at my order, confused as he stared at the unusual toppings. ""Yeah sure, dude. I have to try this shit."" My buddy Mark smiled and winked at me. It was a new pizzeria in town. Apparently they were known for their bizarre combos, so naturally, we had to test out something new.

I laughed sarcastically and shoved it past him. He pulled away from our table with the rest of my other friends while I sat by myself reading my book. I never minded eating alone. In fact, there's even worse tables than this. Like being stuck across from someone who breathes like an oxygen tank leak or people that are constantly on their phone. 

In all honesty, this was pretty much perfect. My best friend and I were hanging out after school before work. There's a chill energy in these types of places. 

After placing my order, I went back to my book. When it came, it was about twenty minutes later because some asshole decided his pizza crust could be eaten simultaneously along with his ketchup. Oh yea. The slices that everyone eats together: that's where people got their orders first. Yeah. The ones without sauce. They didn't give us anything. Some kids asked about ours and our cashier rolled his eyes up to the sky as if he couldn't believe another customer needed help. ""Dude, go find your own slice!""

He threw away my food into a trash can right next to mine.

My blood sugar dropped faster than Mark's ability to carry a drink since school started. ""What?!"" I yelled. We both felt awkward knowing there was nothing we could do, although Mark tried to throw his cup at his friend who was also holding two trays full of spaghetti. The smell hit me harder than the sound of a car crash though. It seemed like days until the first bite but in reality, it was probably five hours longer than usual.

I was confused, this made no sense. But then it hit me. She didn't think I wanted another slice? Why would she do that! This was some kind of sick joke!

As soon as it occurred to me I grabbed the pizza and ran away from the restaurant with my new girlfriend screaming behind me.  She couldn't be serious. There was only 1 other person there. That means...

""Are you on Drugs?"" The lady yelled at me while getting off of the pizza oven timer. ""No,"" I mumbled back to her quickly before running down the road. ""Wait!"" she screamed out to me. I wasn't going to stop though. ""Why?!"" she asked me again, now a little more calmly but still loud enough for me to hear.

And neither can anyone else, for that matter...

I hate pizza with all my heart, as much as I love you. 10/10 would burn in your eyes again without a second thought. It's just... I feel so alone sometimes. Maybe one day we will have a better world where all those who dislike pepperoni hate everything everyone else likes. Or maybe not. 10/10 would cry if i did.

[removed]","A fire flickered merrily in the hearth.  Warmth streamed into the old tavern from the burning logs and cast shadows on the walls where one could have gotten away with a little magic but there was no need tonight.

""Now this is what you call good company,"" said I'm an ancient voice.

""Indeed, sir! Not many get to enjoy a good fire and stories like this anymore.""

He laughed heartily, which I heard echo off of each wall in the place. ""Stories?"" 

""Only those who dare tell them will be remembered for them!""

His laughter ceased. He turned, slowly turning his head so that his eyes were fixed upon me while not having to look at me directly. A single pair of ruby red eyes stared out through my hood and I swear I see a spark go out as they meet mine once more. I let them burn, it's probably best that he loses a bit of temper, after all if I'm going down now it might as well be when he has no other options left. 

Silence descends, a fine silence, broken only by the crackle of the flames outside... and I wish I could hear them better. If any guards are nearby I won't last two seconds past the first of their torches strikes through the wall. That thought brings about my second chance - I can escape using the chimney. Only problem is that there's a huge pile of fresh wood just underneath that doesn't feel too far from the door... 

Another sound comes from my captors - it sounds almost like laughing now, rather than amusement. I turn my head again, looking up at him, trying to make eye contact this time without showing weakness. What am I doing? This is how we should all die! It feels like torture already; waiting to be killed. And yet, here I am, staring intently at the one who must do this act. The cold metal under my fingers makes my mind swim before turning back to reality. One step closer, I think, just a small step forward in hopes it may be enough to save me.

I take the leap.

All the good people of this town know it too! They all smile and wave at me when they see me walk through their doors, smiling and winking as if nothing else matters to them as I enter. Every night I work in my store, the lights are dim, but not because I’m trying to be spooky! Just a normal part of running a business…right? Well, that's what everyone thinks. But there are so many things going on behind closed doors that only he knows, that make it clear I’m hiding something. He’s never shown interest in anything of mine though. Never tries to talk to me like other dudes who try and flirt with me will. Just acts as if he sees nothing to talk about even when we hang out by the pool for days. 
So every day just before the clock chimes midnight I would peek over at his phone as I sat quietly inside. Then, one time I saw her face again. Her smile was still bright and lovely, but now there was nothing behind the eyes that once were filled with pure light and cheerfulness… There were deep sad lines along the corners of those big round eyes, there were dark circles around her eyes that looked darker than the rest of her skin - they reminded me of how dirty the basement looked after she finished cleaning the floors last week. She didn’t speak or move while looking over at her phone.. My heart skipped a beat and turned into an ice cube straight from hell. It did not feel right seeing her on his screen..

[removed]","The night of December 24th is the worst day in the world. No matter what you tell people, it's only a day like any other. Christmas Eve always ends with the same thing: It's as if there were someone waiting for them to pass into their final breaths, and then everyone else would go on about the most annoying things possible, no matter how ridiculous or insensitive they may be. The people who are supposed to have an afterlife don't ever come back. So that means that when we die, even though most do not get the opportunity to see Heaven or Hell, neither of those options exist anymore. Our souls just simply cease to exist. Now I know many religious extremists take issue with this statement, but if you find yourself dying at midnight on Christmas Eve and your heart is failing due to fear after receiving a visit from Santa Claus (as well as several very odd elves that look nothing like the pictures or descriptions) I'm sure these claims will make sense to you.

But that isn't quite the real kicker, either. That actually never happens because everyone knows where each and every one of them live so that no one dies outside the bounds of good standing with Christmas and Easter which should follow right after. But in some cases they can show up early, but it doesn't affect anything at all - because everything has been done in advance. In 1987, when my dad died he was called to be an angel on Christmas Eve instead, and he was in heaven when all hell broke loose! I found out years later why - I spent Christmas Eve watching *Angels Fighting Demons* before work that year, and learned from Satan himself exactly why. If angels, demons, god, or satan - whatever you call him - want to try something new with another entity/person, they first ask Santa. Because Santa delivers gifts to those on Earth that aren't doing much wrong. Everyone does naughty lists around him, and his list goes off in front of every kid regardless. And even then he lets little babies stay on. His decision is ultimate, because ultimately the person gets judged by the ones they spend their life loving the most. God is probably bored now too!

","It's true, every time we all go through life on this earth so that we can live on happily after. For most it was not as much fun as mine was. My friends died too young.

I had my share of problems along the way, but I always turned things around. My entire life, right from when my parents were married until now has been nothing but good fortune. 

The man who called himself Lucifer is wrong. Hell is actually just one single big hospital room. Everyone they choose gets brought there with no choice of where or what state they wind up in. Most get put into nursing homes and wait out the last days of their lives. Mine wasn't nearly as boring though, because his hands were far more rough than he pretended them to be.

He grabbed my soul, and I felt that strange void before everything went black. This place is full of people looking at me, talking about me, watching me but mostly laughing at me. It took me several moments before I could understand why:

""I couldn't possibly have done worse?"" asked a bald woman. ""She got off on raping her husband."" replied another guy with scars upon his face. It took me another moment but then I realized; These guys weren't the worst of sinners...They were just waiting for her to end up here. And she would be joining them soon enough!



That's right. The great thing about getting rid of our soul is that we never really die. We just get sent somewhere else instead. Some souls go straight to heaven while others go to Purgatory or even worse. But the worst destination of all is hell. I suppose the people who want to experience eternity aren't necessarily the best role models after all.


And finally I knew why I found myself trapped in this room for eons. Not only did everyone think it was hilarious - it didn't make any sense to them either how I could keep running over all the sins I had committed to get here. How did Satan do it? Why hadn't I heard about it? Nobody would tell me. They would say things like ""it's a secret kept between us and him"". Or ""oh, don't worry, He wouldn't dare break his promise"". There was a reason he had lied to me back when I first came here. That night was still vivid in my memory. I remember sitting there, knowing deep down that Satan was lying to me but needing someone to listen to me. So I told him everything.


""What I want,"" I remember saying to him, staring deeply into his eyes, was not for anyone to come visit me. ""I want to know the answer to why this happened.""


He chuckled and laughed harder than I had ever seen a person laugh. Then, as if suddenly remembering something important, he smiled again, leaning closer to me. As I leaned closer to him in my misery, I saw the same look of joy in his eye. Now all I felt was pure hate. If he could lie about being merciful towards other souls like mine, maybe I shouldn't expect anything different here.


""As I said,"" he said. ""A demon is supposed to burn eternally after death. Nothing prevents him from making sure his victims continue to suffer regardless of his mercy or lack thereof, unless they try to stop him or escape. What makes humans believe that evil does more than just torment the souls lost within its grasp?""



""But what did you gain?!"" I shouted.


“My power,” he answered casually. ""With each soul I catch I get stronger. And as you are not truly dead, these little visits continue to accrue further strength for me, growing my authority even as I grow less human.""


I wanted to scream again, but my throat remained tight and closed. No one will hear me. His response was immediate and decisive:



“There isn’t anybody here to hear.”



No longer did I see the pain in those damned individuals' eyes. In fact, they appeared emotionless and almost cold when compared to my anger and despair. Soon even Satan would join them in hell once again, his powers waning as everyone he has condemned joined me and him as free men in some other realm beyond human understanding.





“And there will be many more,” he continued with glee. “So prepare yourself,” his voice faded away, echoing in my ears before vanishing into the darkness which surrounds me forevermore. “For when those beings find themselves ready, hell awaits.”

An angel appeared before me with a smile as pure as the driven snow. Her wings held a sheen like sunlight on polished metal. ""There is no 'hell', dear Thomas. I am Lucifer. And for so long I thought he died. But alas, the devil was reborn.""

""Now let me introduce myself."" A second person appeared from behind her - she too was white-winged, but unlike her twin there was dark smoke curling through them. The air became cold around both us and we began shivering as if an arctic wind was blowing. But neither of us shivered more than that tiny bit. He smiled wider.  

""Hello! Hello again!"" It had all happened quickly, or perhaps it hasn't. Two seconds ago I'd never known this guy at all. But now... Now we were shaking hands with smiles wide open and cheeks blushing red hot like fire ants under our palms. We laughed as much as we could muster and it felt good. There was a feeling of familiarity between us that surprised me greatly given how little we knew about each other.

""Thomas, tell me... tell me what year did your life begin?"" She asked. ""How many years of blissful peace must elapse until my punishment shall be fully served."" 

""The birth of Christ?"" I replied hesitantly. The word hung heavy in the mouth; not heavy because of its weight, nor density nor size, but something just heavier than any word you can think of: *bad*.

""Ah well, then your number is 3007 BCE! In the time since you first opened your eyes, the world has begun to decay from within. From your beginnings only thirteen years will remain. No longer will people pray for guidance from God. Rather they shall turn to themselves. They shall call upon demons, evil spirits, those who oppose true good - even one another. Your sin count will reach 50 million..."" The Angel said these words over 15 times but only received the slightest response from me. The two of them seemed to notice and took pity - they spoke softly yet encouraged me onwards. When they finished though my soul screamed bloody murder.

*3007 BBY?! 3007!* How can people be born into this mess? Why do the wicked thrive while the righteous fall away?

To make sure no threads will survive his grasps he takes his toll slowly... One day after another. By the moment of eternity I will be completely naked of anything good and loving but my godlessness will fill him to overflowing - he will feast off my depravity till his satisfaction is met. Until he sees fit. Then he'll throw me back into heaven, or hell, or reincarnation where he'll eat me once again until some new sinner graces the planet and I'll become nothing but a specter of the earth - forever damned for the crime of living.

And so I stand, still and silent as a statue, staring off into space... and crying to none but myself... and laughing...

No amount of pain ever hurt as much as my love.

[removed]","""And to think!"" my dad said aloud on his way out, ""I could have gotten some much better money! If only I had known what it was worth.""

He had been watching me, quietly at first, then more frequently as I finished up with cleaning the mess of broken tools which lay on the floor. It wasn't really mine, but they were free from being tossed in the garbage by an idiot who had left them there carelessly. Sometimes I wondered why someone wouldn't be too happy to get rid of them; they looked like the kinds of things that would give anyone a good headache if they were left lying around the house like this all day long, or worse--a nightmare when they were finally thrown away. But no one else wanted them; and honestly, they seemed pretty cool to me. This set off every alarm bell I thought were still working: the ones telling me that humans were bad news--and should just be left to rot away underground like we did. There *was* something wrong here. That was how the story went at school, anyway. My father took the opportunity to take advantage of it.

""Well,"" he sighed as he came over to where I stood looking down at the ground, ""do you know what I paid for those pliers today?""

I didn't reply, my mind whirring through calculations: 50 bucks would bring me two weeks of food at a normal price. Perhaps even three with proper budgeting. So $100 in cash was plenty to stay alive for two days. Two week was enough time for me to find out who owned these tools, and maybe figure a way to repay my friend's debt.

Instead, my father continued, undeterred. ""Not knowing prices may seem strange to you,"" he explained patiently, as if I hadn't spent the whole summer researching everything that costs money in an effort to repay debts, ""...it is simply the age-old practice of making sure you don't lose any money."" He pulled out his wallet and dropped the ten dollar bill onto the coffee table before pushing his glasses further up his nose.  ""So now that you see what their value is,"" he reached down and picked up one of the tools, holding it tightly in place with his hand so the tip wouldn't fall through the surface of the wood tabletop, ""it seems like an excellent opportunity--to bargain."" He turned towards the cabinet doors, ""My darling, dearie,"" he announced happily. ""It's always quite tempting to bargain--but never actually come to an agreement with someone asking what the worth of *something* is. Your job is to ensure yourself a profit on everything you sell, whether or not its true or not."" He handed me the toolbox, ""Now,"" he continued, ""don't tell me otherwise, because believe me, I can see right through a teenager like you. You won't get far if you aren't willing to bargain."" He paused dramatically, ""And who knows, maybe you'll discover something of high value someday!""


**Later**

The night passed without incident, until the middle of the following evening when several men wearing dark suits, leather jackets, and black masks appeared outside our kitchen window. They carried themselves as though they belonged at work somewhere far above the ground, and moved together as if they expected to break for prayer every once in a while. One of them knocked at the door--a polite knock that echoed the soft click of one of my favourite songbirds' wings beating against the glass panes of the living room window I usually kept open during the evening, letting the wind come in and blow my hair down. He stayed silent for perhaps ten seconds, and the silence seemed almost unbearably loud compared to the sudden clattering sounds coming from my bedroom door. His shoes clicked against the hard wooden panels at least eight times before he opened the door fully and began speaking very quickly.

It’s a good thing that there aren’t other patrons at the kiosk.* “What do you want?” *I sigh through clenched teeth as I put money in and dial 911.* “I can’t believe you guys let me leave without taking my money.” *I mumble through gritted teeth as my blood drains away from the shock he just caused.*

“Listen, it was only $5.07,” *I say. I think he saw that it seemed like an inappropriate amount of money for what I asked for. But I don’t blame him.* He pulls something out from his own pocket before hanging up the phone. The ringing abruptly stops. “It is time that you took your share now, and you know what else? I need a name.”

“Well?” *he says. What’s the point? If we made the deal right then why should I answer the question.* “My name is Jeffrey Jones. A small town man who lost his job recently because everyone thought it would be ok if they were more honest with their boss and less than charitable to each other. Or maybe you forgot. Whatever Jeffreys did wasn’t murder.”* His smile slowly disappears as his eyes meet mine* No matter which one it is. You still owe me.” I reach into my wallet again, but instead I pull out two hundred dollar bills. Why is he smiling? Is something wrong with this phone booth?* This smile seems all too familiar. Something isn’t right. I pull out another twenty-five and give to him. That makes three thousand dollars total. “Thank you so much, Jeffreys!” That’s funny how he called me by my last name. And how long have I been sitting here anyway? Time moves differently from behind these glass panels.* How is he making such a huge smile? All those people are probably looking straight through me. My phone still hasn’t started ringing, though. I take the stack of cash from him, walk to my car. 2366374689.

Why was I ever told to use a payphone? Oh well. At least my friends will look forward to hearing about this little miscalculation. When I get back home I’ll tell them that the guy left my 2 grand bill. They’ll laugh because I actually dropped that much from my cell phone when I got up after calling 911. The police wouldn’t care about an insurance claim either, they never do. I didn’t even call my cell phone, I dialed 911 from a payphone because I had no battery power, dammit.

""Please tell me he doesn't mean...that."" I ask my dad, but first I need him to drive us to our friend's house to hang out with his kids before dinner.",2.171875,0.400390625,1.0703125

There is no other way that is true, unless it's just an exaggeration like ""I can do anything"" which would be completely untrue since there are literally things that no human being on earth can actually do... but you realize this as soon as your wishes start coming true. The most annoying thing about wishing is waiting. You make it through 10 wished before someone else gets bored. Then when they see your ability you decide to wish for them, after asking for permission of course. It never fails.

As you were walking home from work, you tripped over a pile of leaves (no big deal) but you fell flat out because someone who doesn't have superpowers tried to stop you by stepping forward just in time to avoid hurting yourself, their superpower: *Teleportation*. In my country, teleporting is easy because teleports can take place within five minutes of you getting up so while your still sleeping, they run into your room while thinking ""Shit, I forgot something back there! *teleport back*!"" Meanwhile another person has already entered the kitchen where I lay awake wondering why people have superpowers now.


It's finally my turn to use my power though. I think, maybe if only people had superpowers then you wouldn't need to have powers granted because you already have them so everything will be fair. When you ask for your wish, they come out with the dumbest wish ever. So obviously you put your own down, right? Well, wrong again.

","""In return, you will be given everything in life."" The genie proclaimed.

I took a step back as I heard him, but only after it was already too late. One minute he was there telling me his riddle and in a blink, he had vanished from sight, leaving me in confusion and regret.

A second later I realized what he wanted, this couldn't be right... If i was granted everything i want in life would my wishes become bad? After contemplating for an entire second on whether or not my wishes would be good after being granted whatever i wanted for once, all of a sudden a gust of wind hitting me knocking me over. 


As i fell, i saw a massive golden cage drop above me with a huge red heart shape glowing inside. As i got closer to it i realised the glowing heart shape wasn't a solid heart, but rather a door, made entirely out of heart shaped pieces.


Taking a chance i reached for the door; it opened and revealed to me a huge paradise! There were beautiful women dancing around a pool overflowing with water while riding on dolphin sized turtles, kids throwing colorful rings toward laughing angels and even pirates fighting other pirates on cannons shooting out fire while drinking beer. All without any hate, fear, violence or war among them.

After looking at the place for a few seconds i started getting bored and felt like walking through it. It looked exactly the same everywhere! What happened next turned my jaw into a complete 'O' shape: I saw myself entering every single room, swimming past women with dolphins and trying to catch the balls thrown by angels without failing, watching pirate battles happen while feeling no hate or despair towards anyone, listening to children happily playing while knowing the game is just for them and seeing couples kissing and embracing with love without the pain of divorce.

Finally, after weeks upon years had gone by, i decided to go home. Back where I came from - which now seemed miles away compared to how i found myself here. I left the castle and saw a small village nestled between two mountains, covered in smoke coming from chimneys, some houses surrounded by fences and guards checking if someone comes sneaking near. Everyone seemed terrified and suspicious of eachother due to the smell of gunpowder constantly filling the air. People wearing robes full of knives while sitting in front of tiny, dark rooms were always going up to their houses. Children locked in cages and grown people locking themselves in their homes were common. Nothing happy.

Back home, i took a deep breath before answering another question from the genie, ""Why did this world suck so badly?"". He smiled to me after hearing my answer: ""*It wasn't our fault.*""

She hadn't been prepared for when she first encountered the Djinn when she was eleven. In her family tradition (since it was one of the few which weren't completely abandoned by the other people in the world), wishing upon something with enough life in it would bring a djinn into your life if given to it. Her dad didn't think anything of it as he set up his birthday cake on the coffee table. However, once their door opened and the wind blew some debris from the tree outside past their living room window, he went rushing to look and saw it - The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen, but alas, dead. It wasn't until later though that he found out how long ago she died.


She explained what happened over a period of years with him trying to explain things over drinks at cafes between jobs she held since being young while she was still attending high school. He was surprised though that she seemed really happy to be alive again after a decade of death, yet it was easy to see the love she had towards him as well. His daughter took to him like a mother figure, telling him about everything including the fact that he wasn't really dead, and they both enjoyed each other's company. Their age-gap didn't bother either of them because they were more focused on building a relationship. She was glad to finally be back together as mother-daughter, especially since she almost got to see her father before he became ill shortly after his wife passed away. She wished for immortality so she could have spent even more time with him during his remaining days and ensure that he'd be loved no matter what form of appearance came about next. As it turns out, she wishes granted two things: Eternal youth, and the ability to live for as many centuries as she may desire. Though this wasn't enough to save her father, who was 35 when she was born and only lived to be 78, she continued living after his passing in 1994. Now aged 206, and having lost interest in making contact with humans after she became old beyond belief, she simply wants a small amount of happiness; Someone to be her friend as she watches countless wars unfold across countless continents.




The djinn arrived three weeks later looking pale but otherwise uninjured, covered in sand and grime due to the sandstorm he had flown through just after his summoning rituals concluded. He looked around at the furniture in the room expecting to find nothing much of interest besides an unlit candle. He couldn't quite believe he had been transported from the vast desert sands to a dimly lit room in the middle of nowhere. There was certainly no chance he'd be able to see any significant portion of the Earth if he stayed here, and definitely not in the short span he had left before returning to the mortal realms where he came from. With the hopes of gaining some intelligence of her purpose before disappearing there was only one thing to do - ask her a question! The Djinn coughed slightly and addressed her immediately with his question mark voice.""You're...a genie. This should be easier than those people with wings.""

A sharp *beep* startled me. The prompt engine came alive again. It usually takes a bit longer for things to start in here, after all. Something must be wrong? Wait, there goes another beep. My fingers twitch involuntarily, barely able to help themselves moving over the keyboard. The first word appears: 563 Words (Edit) ... Edit?

[removed]","There should be some discussion on this topic

*No racial or ethnic selection for elimination.*
It's obvious to everyone what we have to do when it comes to extermination of certain races/ethnicities and they were chosen in large numbers after only one person voted for the same group over others. We can choose how many are killed.


As an aside I think it would be ironic if we ended up using the exact amount of ""black"" people as those who were not white. It happened with the genocide of Jews where Hitler rounded up 6 million. The Nazi party wanted 4-8 million but chose less because it was hard to get rid of so many at once. But since there were only about 500 thousand jews alive at the time it became easier. We might end up rounding down, eliminating someone to fit our own standards. And I am no one but I am concerned by this.



Other than that the process of determining who gets killed is fairly straightforward: Those who are most productive will get picked first unless their work somehow could benefit humanity by death - we all die eventually anyway. A lot of scientific advancement is coming out of suicide rather than killing each other like humans naturally seem inclined.


I have made a pretty serious decision though: If anyone has kids I'm assuming it will be my job to kill them. As much as I loathe it i believe its best given I don't want an incestuous culture where the children are going to breed more children. They'll come and kill me if they catch me trying it though ;)

[removed]","I have lived on this planet for most of my life: a lifetime where over half the inhabitants have moved from their countries to find more opportunity elsewhere, leaving behind abandoned properties and infrastructure lying fallow and derelict. At first it was only common in the cities, but with the onset of mass migration there came inevitable collapse throughout rural areas: towns were left completely empty save for scavengers seeking scraps and abandoned farms lay rotting beside dusty highways. Now they are moving up north to escape the climate change related disasters that plague Southern Asia and North America and those who are still living below sea level and surviving the water levels rising due to global warming. You never knew your parents. There's no one here to look after you other than your cousins or siblings: you were born into neglect, raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles that were too old, sick or deceased when your parents couldn't afford to leave you behind at least some miles back towards the coast.

Now I am the child alone amongst hundreds who can tell about our home planet, about things everyone else forgot...like what day it actually was before all the internet died, like how much space travel actually costs. Or perhaps just to remember why we moved north in the first place. To save ourselves from ourselves.


You want to know when humanity failed? We didn't fail the same way other species did. We didn't stop because the sun killed us off or an asteroid hit our landmass with enough force to turn everything sterile. No! We succeeded in making ourselves so advanced that we could destroy ourselves faster without even trying. It took three years for humans to reach Mars yet thousands of scientists had already agreed to a cull program that would eliminate anything human that hadn't moved out of Africa to somewhere further away than New York or Los Angeles: a place not affected by rising floods.

And I know something none of you do. Nobody outside this group knows because you simply have never needed the knowledge that I hold. That knowledge gave me reason to trust someone after all these years of misery. A friend told me that he knew when it happened. Someone had written down everything they had thought about doing since the decision was made: all the reasons they couldn't bear to let go of the last remnants of what was once humanity. Some of us believed the author's claim that they wouldn't be contacted again once they committed suicide. And when they hadn't heard from anyone within three days, they attempted again. But each death brought with it a new set of memories: memories that the person who had died experienced. When nobody replied after two months, many began to wonder if maybe the writer was right: maybe the computer program was smart enough that it knew exactly when any given person should die based upon their genetic makeup, their family history, their health statistics - but whether they understood their actions or not was the question on every mind. Then they started wondering about the meaning of their own experiences. If someone's purpose wasn't to live long they might think of suicide as pointless. ""Why not wait longer?"" they thought. So now we must make the impossible choice. Do we choose to die sooner rather than later? We can't possibly expect another person to survive for another ten thousand years after what mankind has done to himself; his children won't be able to do it either...after a while I don't see why it shouldn't be anyone of the billions that remain. And the survivors aren't better off either--they don't seem to mind killing us anyway.



**How to use information:** This character is speaking to someone in his cellmate, an assassin sent to kill him by the United Nations as part of the 'Project Genesis' programme that promised that the world would be reborn once its resources were properly replenished. The assassin has known little of his past (he has only seen pictures) except the fact that he was abused both physically and sexually; in addition, he has only been given the bare minimum information about why humans may need eliminating (resource depletion). Thus, the man believes his life is worth less than the rest of humanity. He doesn't understand why others will accept genocide if they themselves are victims of genocide, but wants to explain himself and convince the boy to stay alive.
- *Note that the main protagonist isn't necessarily hostile to the assassin, simply curious about him.-



It occurred to him, finally, that the assassin was probably dead and gone by now. They did say assassins usually got paid well. Maybe next time he could earn his keep being shot though: there weren't that few bullets in his system.  Of course neither would the government pay him back for a couple hundred dollars spent travelling northwards. It wasn't like they would give him anywhere close to ten times that amount, but paying for transport wouldn't matter as he would have returned to poverty once he joined his family near the coast. Only he would never get there, and he realised that thinking about where he'd end up didn't interest him anymore.
*After all, he was still alone.*

[removed]","This is an interesting prompt, here's my take on it:

I. **The Criteria** (for making this easier I made a bullet list but these are very broad):
     - Intelligence
     - Education
    - Skill Sets
    - Family & Social Network/Influence (how many people they would impact)
    - Health/Lifespan
    - Wealth/Financial Resources
     - Physical appearance or strength
     - Length of time living in current society and generation

II. **Justification** (in a nut shell, there isn't really one):
     - The idea is that humanity is struggling with overpopulation, so rather than have everyone pay for resources in order to survive, we as a group are going to do what can be done to cut down the number of humans who need resources by killing all but the top 1% or .1%. Essentially killing the majority human race saves us from a slow societal collapse, even if that means some must die for others.
     - As such, due to this being something where a single person *could* make an impact on how long someone lives, any individual with more than trivial skills could put me at risk.

III. **Results** (the actual people you deem fit to keep alive):
     - I doubt anyone would qualify unless they have exceptional skill sets. Like the doctors, scientists, etc., because the point is not to wipe out every single talent or genius, just those in positions where they may *potentially* save the planet, though honestly no other way is available

IV. **Disputes**
     - There was supposed to be another set of rules like ""only children are allowed"", this came up when some argue ""so why don't you only kill children?"". It was pretty obvious that if that's the rule then it breaks the spirit of the question and thus wasn't accepted.

""I'd say we should look at things like birthrate. If birthrates are high, then as time goes by the population will continue to grow rapidly. This can cause problems but also means there will always be a population large enough to carry on human civilization."" The man in the chair said.

""That's assuming that population growth causes exponential increase over time. But if the population starts to stabilize after reaching its carrying capacity, this could give us an idea of what population levels will remain sustainable,"" Another man spoke from beside another woman who had long auburn hair pulled into a single braid. ""But the problem with this is that determining how many babies each pregnant mother can actually handle is impossible.""

""It's worth discussing though. It makes sense logically,"" Said the first man.

""But as I said, it's practically impossible to know which females would survive past the natural attrition rate."" The women interjected.

""Look, regardless of your opinion, we need a basis other than just a number on some sheet of paper."" An older man whose face seemed permanently worn out added.

""How about age?"" Suggested another young man.

""Age also doesn't work. We are all going to die anyway. Children are much more difficult to raise than adults, and as such their numbers shouldn't differ too greatly between nations or cultures."" Another voice joined in.

""We have already chosen what countries to eliminate..."" said one of the three men at the front of the room. All three were identical in appearance except for their color-coded shirts. Their heads were down, listening intently to the crowd assembled. They shuffled forward in unison with a click of their shoes against floorboards. The voices continued as they started filing back to their seats.

The five remaining people watched as two other pairs of eyes peered up ahead. One was wearing a sky blue shirt and the other was green. It wouldn't even have been particularly unusual to see these colors, for they stood at the front table just as easily as the others. However, none had spoken so far.

It's an honor to be chosen by God (or whatever power decided to watch over us in this game) The gods must love everyone else because we only get that once every century or two, although I haven't heard back in years

Anyway, now that I am here, I can finally experience happiness again and not be miserable while trying to kill myself (thank you RNGesus! \o/). But there's one thing I don't understand: What does this do for my friends? They are also being killed off by the Gods, who apparently decided that anyone without at least half of all good luck had some benefit (whether divine, demonic, supernatural, or otherwise). My friend who hates video games became obsessed, his soul has been damned to live forever playing Super Mario Bros. His friend who doesn't eat vegetables any longer has gained immunity from plants and is now immune to all poisons and toxins except ones created via bacteria. My other friend was given immortality when he turned gay, his heart still belonged to Mary-Jane. And it goes on and on and on

","The man turned up late to his work presentation today. He hadn't realized he was five minutes late... but then again that's probably not all of it.

He found his desk empty, though a note sat left for him on the keyboard: ""Sorry, I had to go pick something up from the post office. Be right back!"" Signed, 'M'. So much for getting in early, eh? 20 minutes later... another note. ""Just got off of a very confusing phone call where some dude was yelling at me over a very stupid issue that apparently wasn't even my fault. Talk soon, M"". A lot of confusion still remained, but now it seemed more like there were several people to figure out - the first few weren't all too hard to figure out however, since the two guys who worked next to him both walked past by them when they came by after seeing the two notes in a matter of minutes. Neither of those two really helped either though - if anything their lack of any answers simply made the situation worse.

So, they waited around for their boss to get there while wondering what the heck was going on. 28-minutes later... and the answer is finally here. All it takes is a quick look at her face, and you can tell exactly why she didn't show. It seems pretty obvious to anyone that wouldn't be there; she must have gotten hit with the worst case scenario imaginable. As if the world couldn't get *any* more random, they saw an absolutely massive lightning bolt strike somewhere near the building just outside of the window.... They watched as smoke rose into the air. But this wasn't anything too dramatic, or scary really. It was just as they'd hoped, nobody else seemed to notice.

No more than 3 days later, they got the news everyone felt deep down was coming: they hired someone else to replace her. Nobody else knew how she suddenly quit so quickly, especially since everything was looking fairly good on paper anyway. No matter, whatever happened before that, no one could do more damage at this point.

","It started with one of my neighbours having more hits on their website than ever before when I first discovered that they have the most recent lottery winning tickets on every other street in our town. They must win every week or so as it becomes obvious as soon as the winners are contacted but then some dumb fuck fucks up by not taking their prize or something stupid like that.

In all honesty though the lottery was never my interest. It only became such a spectacle because the winner is always someone nobody knows and no news gets to them for 24 hours at least after it's announced until the asshole shows up to say something about how he didn't know he should get an attorney. By time shit kicks off everyone is laughing at them for taking so long and they end up becoming known for something else by default. The rest of us just play for fun and try to see what will finally be the thing we actually wanted. That is still years away for me.

","“Ugh, so many people in this queue! You’d think for a place as popular as the Lucky Lady’s Cafe, they wouldn’t let any more people in.”

“Not to me? You must be incredibly unlucky today!” 

The old witch looked into the girl’s tired eyes and chuckled softly. “No, my dearie. I do love it when someone says that. Just an average day after all.”

She walked over and gestured toward the back of the line where another man stood by himself with his head cocked sideways. He held a little bell in hand he swung around, making odd noises that kept getting louder, until he let out a loud bang from it that shook everyone around him including the staff. The witch moved closer and placed her hands on her shoulders as she began to cackle. This guy was special…and not just because of his ringing bells. She quickly made her way to the counter and started filling out paperwork in great hurry. When she returned she gave a large cup full of liquid and three slices of fruit with her signature. They handed them to the girl who paid the lady and ran off without even giving a word or look at anyone but had to be looking desperately over everyones shoulder again.

The witch sighed as she picked up the bell-ringing guy. It seemed like she needed something to distract herself. As such she spent the next few hours cleaning behind the curtain wall to the seating area and then went to play some cards with the other two waitresses. That turned out quite poorly.

Her laughter echoed through the room. For once, she had lost all of her money.

My jaw clenched as he slowly rose from his seat and smiled.

A light flashed behind him as two soldiers in a military uniform ran into the coffee shop. They scanned through the room like hunters looking for their prey before stopping near where my supposed friend sat, pointing guns at both him and myself. The one standing by me pointed his gun towards me first, ""Hands over your hands or this is gonna be messy"". I put my hands up and he quickly lowered them, smiling again while raising up something from under the table. It seemed to be an enormous amount of money stacked on a small wooden box. In about 3 seconds it fell apart, revealing what looked like a small device. It resembled a detonator, just too perfect. If only he had chosen his words differently. Or if only I hadn't listened to my heart instead of my brain. Everything went dark.

""Are you sure this is right?"" said Harry, looking back over his shoulder toward the coffee house's entrance as he stood outside watching through the large windows of the doorway.  They stood there for several minutes before he stepped out of the van into the snow.  He saw them in front of him walking together towards the cafe.  Two very old men walked down into the cafe.  Harry watched from across the street, while John checked the car stereo as they approached the entrance door of the coffee house.  He grabbed his shotgun from under his seat.   Harry stayed standing there for several moments wondering if it was wise that he had gotten out of the van at all and whether or not his decision to follow them today would be fatal to himself.

He walked towards the cafe steps quietly taking cover behind one of the potted plants next to the steps.  As the two men pushed open the doors behind them he waited until the door closed then fired three shots as quickly as could be expected from John's automatic weapon. The gun barked loudly as flames shot up toward the vaulted ceiling as the men fell. They didn't look like they would get the chance to even see what hit them. ""Good job."" said John from the driver side of the vehicle.

","""You were a hero!"" the barista said in an incredulous tone. ""My mom says that about every customer.""

""She's probably right,"" I replied. 

I knew this guy wasn't going to be able to help me out so when he asked me what I needed, my first instinct was to just order it and leave. But as I watched the barista move his eyes away from my bloody prosthetic finger and back towards me, I remembered why I had come to this small town after killing thousands of people. This town had always been one of our safest havens during the civil war and now it seems like nothing is going to change. My brother had told me before he went south for college that we would return here when things settled down. And everything did settle down, almost exactly 78 days after the war started. It seemed the only ones to actually settle down were the government troops stationed outside the city and no human was hurt while they waited there or in their camps near us. The worst thing was that those soldiers weren't even allowed into the city after the evacuation began. They hadn't let them in after the bombing either. They hated us all; some still think we deserved to be attacked for the war. Some believe that we were cowards or terrorists or worse. They had done their best job tearing down my family's business during the war without ever firing a shot themselves; the man had been hiding behind trees too afraid to step out of his basement where he sat through weeks on end writing hateful notes about those who believed him wrong, letters he kept piling up as evidence for the war crimes that would end up prosecuting millions of innocent lives.

""What?""

When I looked down to see he wasn't looking me dead in the eye anymore, I realized this might not have gone how I planned.

""He doesn't want to talk about it anymore!"" I snapped. ""And I don't know if anyone does but he's being forced to listen to the hatred all these guys throw around now and he can't take it anymore.""

","I had told myself I'd be angry that I still survived when they came for me. Angry enough that would force myself to kill another man. What did someone take away from my life? My right arm, my ability to lift anything heavier than thirty pounds, most of the things in my apartment, like this goddamn cup. Did I hate my government? Nah... just some asshole soldiers that thought they could do whatever they wanted because I did what they told me. They wouldn't have gotten it if we were fighting over something else though.

*Flashback: Iraq.* The building shook violently, making me lose my footing on top of rubble. I grabbed onto a wall to keep from falling into it as a second blast went off nearby killing one of my buddies near where I stood. His blood splattered everywhere. This guy stepped back with ease before running off through a doorway. *End Flashback.* He looked at me with rage flashing through his eye and a sadistic grin spreading over his face, ""Finally got you"", he said, picking up the gun he just put down and shooting himself. One thing that made him so hard to kill was how he always saw the last remaining member survive by taking them down like I did him. *Flash to now:* He took out the pistol in his pocket, firing several bullets through his temple. He let out a loud yell then lay on the table lifeless.

I couldn't believe this shit again after being shot in half last week. After giving him a quick check-up at the hospital, Dr. Lee decided that he should receive a full prosthetic for his hand and leg before going home. Luckily, he healed pretty quick which helped speed up their healing processes as well. Even though, in all actuality, I found him first while trying to hide out here. Dr. Lee gave him a special serum every once in a while that kept his wounds from getting infected, which allowed him to return to work within weeks. But alas....shit happens, as usual.

But anyways, since he wasn't the bad guy I just beat into death anyway, I took off my mask, ran outside to go smoke, knowing exactly where he would be waiting and took a swing at him right across the jaw and knocked him flat on his ass, right after he kicked in his door and charged at me, ""So this is how our story ends?"" She asked as she scrambled away, spitting blood on her clothes.""Let's see you try and beat me,"" she yelled before running off screaming.

Damn those bastards. Seriously why did they get promoted?!
""You guys are really going to die here aren't you?"" A voice came closer towards me slowly until I saw an ugly motherfucker standing there with a look of disgust in his eyes. And boy oh boy had he looked down at me with rage! He cocked his revolver nervously as he backed away slowly. ""If you don't mind, i'll just leave you two poor idiots here. Now git!"" *Clink!* Someone jumped around behind the motherfucker and started throwing elbows before slamming his head repeatedly in concrete, and blood poured out of his nose until finally he fell limply to the ground dead. Then his body began to pulsate and form into an armored humanoid robot with metal arms instead of legs with glowing red armor.
[Red Robot] ""My god those bastard punks will pay for this."" Said the robot softly looking down at the fallen monster. ""Well fuck those little brats im going out in style. Hey hey hey, do not worry, they will have plenty more coming. Oh yea, thats right, they're called the super army robots, cuz they've been engineered to make sure everyone dies when they arrive. That is the point of all this isn't it? To wipe out every living goddamn soul? We do what we have to do in order to win. Sorry about your friends, sorry about your family and even sorry about yourself. They all will be taken care of someday too.""

[RED ROBOT:]  ""Just like all of you here. You will enjoy a long stay in heaven forever. Or wherever you come in on these buses on the way to heaven and hell. As one big giant funeral. If you know what I mean.""

The Red Army Robot suddenly turned to both of us with a grin on its face that chilled us to the bone and walked over toward me, stepping right beside me, letting his icy blue eyes meet mine. ""Now what brings you out for a walk alone today mister?"" He asked kindly.   ""How did you figure that out?"" I asked in shock at his sudden intelligence. He chuckled to himself, ""Oh yeah, you think it might sound stupid or something? No idea why anyone would ever doubt me. Especially when I'm wearing military uniform. So tell me mister, what time are you planning to end all of this mess you two caused for me and everybody here?""

","This is the start of my daily journal entry.

*August 29th, 2015: Another loop completed.* I was just thinking to myself when I turned around on cue to hear if I had made a wrong turn or not; did someone come close behind me? Was this safe? The room I ran into looked familiar--did these people come through at the same time each loop but we don't notice their presence until they are near enough to actually see them?: Yes. Did they run behind us from where we could have easily tripped them up? No. Did I get away free or somehow end up hurt? I ended up hurt, as I am currently getting put back to bed after being treated by paramedics. *What does this mean?* Why do I know what this means, and why aren't there any real-life doctors, police men, and women here watching me. Am I crazy? Do I really remember this moment more than what happened in the hospital? My memory must be failing because everything about me that has become clear makes perfect sense given recent events. Oh god tell me its okay

I tried my hardest to make it last longer so nothing would happen to me while I was trapped. That's one thing I know though that my friends were terrified when I got injured this time round and then I remembered some other things. As far as my memories go, I was sitting with them all and talking to them; they weren't happy with me at all as I started doing my usual tricks for how they worked together to try and save me from the car accident. It wasn't funny anymore--they really thought I had gone off the deep end, which I probably did. They didn't seem surprised at all--some of them looked like they had expected me to come back unscathed still. That bothered me even more--as a little kid, I couldn't make excuses for myself to explain I got a booboo or sprained an ankle, and neither could my parent--so maybe I really did lose my mind and hallucinated all of my injuries.--no way. If this is reality I wouldn't be able to survive for long. Where's the door to escape? Is there anyone else stuck inside? What does it mean...? I have too much going on right now. I have too many questions. Time out.

","I knew I didn’t act like myself at least once before. I woke up to a bright light in my room, an eerie silence and felt something cold on my cheek.

“What is happening? Who’s there?” I muttered, trying to remember what happened but all I could recall was the cold night I died. Now however…this is just stupid stuff I made up. The only one of these things even remotely familiar was the ice water flowing down my throat as I went unconscious; “Did I die” I thought “No I can’t be dead.” It seems illogical given how much time had passed since my last life after all: the time has passed into eternity but yet here I am, living the same bloody hour twice more than me. If everything else did happen then this must be something special about me or maybe I simply needed sleep. “This is absurd, if I die tomorrow will I find out the reason why I never ended up pregnant then?”

Suddenly I felt the warm sensation of sunlight again - a feeling I haven’t experienced for over 3 years. This is ridiculous; every loop repeats the exact same way. I open my eyes and stare past the curtains to get another look - “It is so good to see sunshine.” I murmur to myself. What the hell! Where is everyone?! All I had were the sounds of crows squawking in the distance. A flock flies overhead, I watch their wing strokes as they soar towards me. How long have I been here? Why do birds talk to me? Am I delusional now? These are dumb questions which aren’t stupid though - surely not. I need to go back and ask those questions. Maybe when I wake up from this dream I’ll finally understand somethings. I rise from my bed and prepare for action.

Today starts as usual as I run around my neighborhood doing my daily chores, feeding cats, making pancakes for breakfast etc. When I start getting ready for work I take extra time on my appearance. Today, I dress nicely, put on makeup and wear high heels to make myself feel good. After a short period of time I hear the sound of keys jingling outside. My boss isn’t supposed to have his personal vehicle parked under our building. Well…unless…. He’s driving here for work. But how is that possible he doesn’t have any sort of transportation. I decide to go into my apartment to check for anyone who might have come by; the apartment is vacant right now and empty except for my suitcase sitting beside me next to my computer desk. Wait, where does a suitcase belong?!

The sight sends shivers down my spine, sending goosebumps across my body. “A suitcase,” I mutter “That’s weird,” There wasn’t a trace of life form in the bedroom whatsoever. The door swung slightly open revealing the kitchen. Nothing in the kitchen, nothing in my bathtub, nothing in the storage closet. I run up to my bedroom closet and push the doors open wide. I can feel the air growing stale and heavy. It smells like old clothes and the scent of burnt toast. Oh no. Not now. I stand frozen in my tracks taking in the sight of hundreds of suits lining the walls. Suits that are exactly identical. In fact they seem real enough and I hesitate before putting on one of them to inspect my reflection. Something isn’t right. They shouldn’t fit me properly unless the ones in the front row were bigger than this. “Are you kidding me?” I yell while looking at the size of the jacket covering the first suit; “Well that’s awkward” I chuckle and shrug off the suit throwing it onto the floor while picking the first one up off of the shelf instead. “Oh well,” I say “At least I’ll still fit inside this one,” I try it on hoping the result would change. “Nope I don’t fit in this either!” As panic builds up I pull the shirt out of its plastic bag. “Why did I purchase the sweater online for today?” I curse myself for being stupid earlier, what are these idiots wearing without fitting attire! “How should I deal with this situation?!”

","The first time I hit my head against the wall, I thought, ""It was stupid.""

It has happened to me three times, in different places in the world but all within fifteen minutes or so apart (the locations are always random), I didn't think much of it at the time. For some reason though, every single time I had to slam the nearest solid object into the face and then crawl under something soft to feel a rush of pain followed by drowsiness. It would last about ten minutes then I would wake up and start this whole cycle again each time. After several months it did get to be a habit.

The next couple of days I tried remembering what i was doing when it happened, I wanted to see if maybe there is any pattern but nothing really came up. I went through my schedule. Work, meeting friends from college, etc. All pretty regular activities until Friday afternoon at around 5pm. I remember sitting in my favorite place in town looking out at the city, thinking I knew the end of one life was near as I held her hand, waiting on the bus home. I don't think she felt as lonely as I did. When someone died I found solace in knowing others were going through the same fate too. Not anymore.

It felt weird going back to where we first met. The memories flooded back immediately, a wave crashing upon us as tears streamed down our cheeks. We didn't need words to say how deeply we loved each other anymore; it was obvious and we both knew how things were going to end - even without being able to avoid death, it only seemed right that once you lost everything else in life, you go into each and every day feeling complete.

I still miss her dearly though, she was incredibly special and I know after this everything will seem a bit duller. At least now I can do it a lot more often, because who am I kidding? If anyone could fix the problem I should probably thank them instead of lamenting our lost. I smiled as I heard my name called and ran toward the sound. There she was as usual. We walked out of there just like before and drove off together. I know I'm not supposed to feel happy about that, but I feel happiness whenever I hold her hand because she feels happiness when I do the same. She tells me how happy her life will be when I die, telling me I'll finally experience the things we never got to do. Like seeing the stars since she's blindfolded. So many memories flash across my mind while driving down the street, each one brings a different emotion: happiness, sorrow, confusion, wonder and most importantly, love. I couldn't ask for anything better than being dead by her side as soon as this week comes to an end.

","*In an abandoned building by the coast, some old guy was staring into the dark water.*

""Today is Monday."" *He said as he rubbed his eyes, glancing towards the water below him.* ""I hope I get to see today sometime soon."" *It had been too long, since the light faded.*

He reached in his pocket, finding nothing but empty space where once there were cigarettes and matches. They weren't even out yet. Today would come eventually if they ever came at all, but until then, all he could do was wait patiently in his little alcove for something to turn around.

But this time, it hadn't happened. All was quiet on the island, which only brought new terror as he stared down at his feet. The water glistened with life, or did it? In order, he thought he saw movement flicker through the depths, before disappearing just as quickly as it appeared. *Wait, why are my hands still dry?* He wondered to himself as he reached down slowly; he found nothing but rough grains of sand. *No, wait! Why can't I remember my name!? Is this what happens when you die?!? Do people go to hell now?? What the fuck is going on?!* 

The man ran back into the seafoam, his heart hammering as his eyes searched desperately for answers. Maybe someone who drowned here knew how to fix this. Or maybe he wasn't dead anymore. But right now, he didn't care so much for those specifics because he knew one thing: it was wrong. This world was wrong somehow. His fingers gripped his shirt.

And while it may be hard for a viewer like me reading this to understand this situation right now, all the reader will comprehend are these words and their lack of context - the same thing that you would encounter if you read them from another person.

His jaw clenched, “You know damn well, bitch-ass.” he spat on my floorboards. This vampire hated to pay his taxes every year. It wasn’t that he was a criminal or anything like that. He just disliked paying what should have been given to him as a freebie since he didn’t actually work much and only did so under duress. If this vamp could kill 70 innocent people in one go and still had enough blood left over for himself, then why can’t he just donate some? The fact of the matter is, the poor bastard probably forgot how hard he worked! I tried not to let that bother me. Vampires like that always come in during the low season: when there weren’t many humans about. There was a reason I got promoted after 2 years.

I said as I slowly walked up to him, my gun aimed at his chest. 

The man froze, shaking as he fumbled through his shirt pockets. Finally pulling out a small wad of crumpled papers. His teeth bared in fear, tears forming down his eyes from sweat dripping down his face from the cold that day had been making. He handed me the papers with trembling hands. The smell of blood still hung heavy in the air as if he was just fed moments ago. 

A single tear rolling over his eye, dripping down, ""1297... 428. And no more than that.""

As I finished reading, I began looking at him, now trying hard to hide himself behind me instead of walking away to try to flee. I wanted to let him go today, seeing as how he hadn't paid any dues recently so it wasn't much on him. But tonight he would become another victim. A little less fattened like yesterday. This time there wouldn't be any mercy given but when he finally did get eaten, people would learn a lesson about not screwing their job off and underpaying their duties. 

His body layed on the ground like some kind of doll, lifeless with a smile formed by dried blood. 

Another human soul, another life taken before the sun rose to devour its warmth and bring into this world another night.

She sat there, head bowed while her eyes rolled about. Every time he came close to taking them off his gaze would drop for just half a second making me feel like we could never truly be apart. 

It was as though we were always under an impression that if she loved him she must hate me or if he loved her he hated me and vice versa. And as long as our families lived in separate countries with different bloodlines they could never get together. This was our only hope at living happy ever after and seeing each other one day in eternity. 

His voice dropped to a hushed whisper so quiet it made my body tingle the way we do before we sleep when he told us to shut up so no noise wakes the baby up: ""One more trip and then your first visit is over,"" he said to me and kissed my forehead. I ran through the hallway and out into the waiting wings where an endless row of tables awaited the people their money owed in taxes or the people who had not paid in decades. It didn't matter at this point, as there wasn't enough time for anyone to escape these hands tonight. They wouldn't take any from me. My family weren't born yet, but soon they might be taken. I need every last penny for that day. Even now I am afraid to have too much fun. I'll keep running on adrenaline, hoping that whatever happens after tomorrow will bring me some kind of miracle.

We had been dating since high school because he had sworn that the laws surrounding our relations would change. He felt the same sense of dread as I did, but he wanted to stay home because of everything he knew would happen. Instead he was still going, coming back and forth like he was doing right now.  He has to know what awaits us.

The next morning I started my shift again. I hoped it would be a good day; it was one of my better nights. The man sitting at table number three kept telling me about how glad he was. His brother had already joined us six months ago. In case I forgot, his mom died two years ago. She became the ninth in line of a bloody succession. Now it seems like even though vampires have become the dominant power in the world everyone is ready for the rest. It doesn't matter what type of monster you may be. Once the count becomes low you're all just another human being trying to survive in a godless void.

""How many kids do you have?"" asked the vampire at table four, looking me dead serious as we continued our walk towards their seats. I looked away and answered him honestly. A simple answer like that usually led to something nice from him... maybe a gift or an extra hour before curfew when I left for work the next day. I don't need gifts or privileges. All I needed was to live. If only it was that simple.

","It was an ordinary day in 2140. I just so happened to be one hundred metres south east from my favourite watering hole when the two giant metal ships came out of thin air and started flying over the land. The sky suddenly changed colours as if it were all changing colours into something blue or orange. What was going on?

I looked up ahead of me with my eyes wide open thinking what I could see but then it just took off! They flew down in front of me and shot laser beams at each other. When they shot at each other that got a loud noise coming from their engines. Then both engines turned red. Red, like red hot fire from hell would shoot out of them. And you knew that those guns were real. Both planes crashed to the ground and burst apart. 

A small helicopter landed before me. ""We are from Earth and now we will take back our lands."" I looked at the soldiers and they said, ""Now you shall pay for what you've done!"" Well, maybe we deserved death after all those years of killing, but this should have ended so many years ago. Maybe it could have.

""How dare they?!"" I shouted at my wife. She laughed. “Why must we always assume that those creatures here on earth aren’t worthy of life?” Her words made her laugh even harder.  She thought she was funny. That woman couldn’t believe how many people died because we’d wiped out all the animals except us humanoids. I’m not sure why they didn’t kill humans first since there were probably more humans than dinosaurs when the animals lived. No matter, who am I to question what some aliens do? In any case now we had access to whatever resources we needed, all thanks to the new arrivals!

“So, how about it?” My wife asked me. “What do you say?” There were tons of shiny metals that aliens had taken. All I had to do is trade half of mine to them in exchange. My friends were doing the same thing, so what’s so wrong with me? Why does everyone give others credit when they take things without asking? I decided I can only lose. If the aliens don’t come back tomorrow, I’m fine with losing everything. But if they come back, oh god, what will become of my family? Especially my children! I know I am greedy, I need weapons. Lots and lots of them. Hopefully none of my enemies in the area get them first. After all, no one else here has any real reason to steal from me.

The plane took off as soon as we got out and I watched it fly away until nothing was left standing and then looked around my own little piece of the world hoping maybe some animals would have grown too since I didn't know what animals were even there.

","**Please note: I will take your name if you want me to continue the story.**

""Well,"" said Professor Giblets in his best imitation of an American accent, ""That was one hell of a ride."" The old man looked back at the two soldiers as their uniforms were falling off them, he smiled, remembering how they'd come here. In many ways it felt like decades ago, yet it only had been a few hours since they left the military plane to see the world again.

The doctor sat on the ground next to him, looking at his monitor which showed their last breath on camera screens. One by one he looked down each screen. He remembered when all humans weren't this pale and gaunt, but most of the ones on earth now looked this way due to being fed nutrient paste for several generations. That used to be called 'nutrition'. Humans didn't die of starvation anymore, and that's how they had remained so happy, content with life until... well, anything else arrived. 

He wanted to laugh, yet no sound came out. He couldn't remember what laughter was any more, just the small crackle in his throat whenever he attempted. Even smiling was difficult now; just another pain that would slowly add to the ache that seemed to sit between each bone in his body.

A strange feeling had risen within the professor as soon as they landed. When Earth first turned to dust, there wasn't much fear or excitement amongst us. It simply felt as if everything would get better from our position. We got what we deserved after all, hadn't we? Those other beings who ate meat? Those stupid ones who hunted those primitive things? The fact they even decided to do something about these creatures made this whole mess inevitable - in the eyes of the humans at least, we knew nothing could be done anyway. This planet was meant to support human consumption and nothing more.

It's the same reason why aliens never dared to colonize us. If some superior intelligence chose to eat its slaves, then perhaps they're really not too intelligent at all. After millions of years of struggling to live under a sky with clouds, fighting battles against the elements constantly and battling disease, they still did not understand the simple physics that governs space travel. For hundreds of centuries prior, every civilisation had existed purely because of a single question:

Can we survive? Is there a better planet out there for humans than this one where we may die of disease forever? All answers that ended up being no eventually destroyed humanity. So the aliens finally figured out that problem and decided to go ahead with colonization, but once they stepped foot on earth, they realized just how dense humans are in terms of thought. They thought that their superiority in technology would allow them to easily exploit the rich resources of this world without any problems. 

In order for such advanced aliens to actually be able to colonise this planet, they needed a host race that wouldn't stand up to them. They went through the proper procedure and found humans fit the bill. Human stupidity was the perfect host for an invasion, they considered. How sad it would be to watch your own kind slowly consume itself from within before seeing the end result of your folly though. Perhaps you should call them 'the destroyer,' they reasoned. Some people named them that during the conflict we knew was coming from early accounts, but they never expected us to fight so valiantly. No, they saw death as the solution to all conflicts - and in a way they were right. No matter how hard they fought, they couldn't stop us from defending ourselves from them. They became victims themselves and started fighting amongst each other instead of us, creating endless conflict upon us over land, territory, water and most importantly... our minds.

So much time passed after they died that the humans didn't realise that new species had evolved during their absence, and thus were now far stronger than what they initially planned. Their attempt to bring back the dinosaur wasn't actually that surprising - most extinct animals were fairly easy to reconstruct using their preserved DNA, despite scientists believing that it could not be possible. However, the true test was not merely rebuilding their bodies, but also their minds. These dinosaurs were created according to records and notes left behind from the original conquerors, but they were given different genetic material than the humans and lived separate lives on earth. Only now were all this finally combined - but there was hope that this experiment wouldn't fail like others have in past attempts.

At least, that's what everyone hoped.

Her words were prophetic. As far as life on Earth went, this seemed like the beginning, a grand adventure for her and me. This was our moment to break out of Earth’s tyranny, to get away from those who would judge us. Those who doubted us. To escape them forever. But instead, we found ourselves standing face to face with space: vast expanse dotted with countless stars that were almost as brightly shining as my wife’s eyes.

","I woke up with no memory.  No clue who I was or how long I had been asleep. It only came when some of my muscles started screaming for pain as they started working again in this new century of 3061.

""The hell happened to me?"" I told myself. ""How did I get here? Is this an accident or is something worse going on?"" The thoughts were interrupted by a flashing image from the rearview mirror as I tried to see out. Some sort of emergency beacon, probably sent from the other astronauts from my ship.

On the wall next to me was another image - this one displaying a large ring of light behind a single star. This could be one of those rare events where it just so happens we are near a black hole. As I continued to think it over, a small blue box appeared above me, displaying what looked like an address: `7842 W-855`. After typing it in, I saw the location of where it pointed to - on Earth, in New York City; but way back in the 19th century. That got my blood pumping again. This could be one crazy coincidence!


As soon as I heard the beep and the message below, however, everything went dead silent. No more beacons, no more flashes, nothing at all. Then...everything started screaming. A bright flash blinded me, shaking me off any sense of reality until I woke back up as before.


Another two months passed once I regained full consciousness again, yet nothing seemed different. Just after waking up I found a tiny red button inside my suit, labelled as such. It wasn't too hard to press as my hands warmed up enough again. Whatever triggered it was likely already done with, though...



After seeing what happened once, I realized what must have caused this to happen. The crew would never do anything stupid like pass through a space anomaly during their routine trip - it would have been suicide. If it wasn't due to human error, then it would be due to some major mechanical malfunction within our ship which may also mean suicide; either way, I am now alone.




Then finally I found the words: 'Goodbye world.'





And so I went to sleep.

","My son was 6 months old and I was running the most recent successful hunting trip to my grave yet. I didn't know it but my last victim had mistaken me for something else, because when I arrived home there was another human lying under an oak tree in our backyard, but when my partner turned him over he had no cross marks but many fangs. The first time we met a man with fangs while working as vampire hunters we never took them seriously. He was just one of many humans trying his luck at drinking our blood as vampires so why couldn't they learn better?

""Well well well, looks like we have a new addition to the family."" My partner laughed as she stood behind her own scythe while holding a bowl full of candy corn. ""You seem pretty familiar with what happens when vampires turn into a human again don't you? Well let's see if you can avoid getting your neck punctured this time!"" She threw down the candy corn onto the floor while backing away slowly. There is no way in hell I could ever get a shot off with those claws! I backed out of our apartment building through back door before locking it up from the inside. Why would someone even bother attacking us? We were a team...but nobody pays any attention to teams these days. I looked across the street. That stupid dog walker was still walking around with that damn leash on. Now's my chance! Running like hell to catch him, I tripped over the bag of trash sitting beside the building's dumpster and fell face first. As much as I hated hurting others, especially not a kid, biting and sucking out their heart all at once wasn't going to happen here. Not again anyway. After getting back up I tried to find my car keys. They were right here at the entrance of our alleyway. I swear they weren't here two seconds ago! Taking my sweet ass time checking each corner I finally found them beneath the awning of the local restaurant across the street. The restaurant smelled nothing but burnt coffee. This has happened multiple times. My neighbor John must be burning his beans every night without thinking! I got in my car and put the key in ignition started revving engine up. I took a quick glance back to ensure I did indeed have the car locked. I had made sure of this several times now. Damn people must be looking for easy wins. Taking the usual route north to the highway I sped to keep myself in sight of the diner owner. I noticed some weird shit going on as I went closer which made my heart skip a beat. A group of about 10 children were standing in a square shape near the bus stop, maybe a dozen blocks from where my parents left me there years ago...I stopped to look at the sign but I guess I missed it coming up quickly because there wasn't much visible except the word ""children"" next to a yellow school bus. Was this a trick or some kind of scheme? Nah its probably just John messing with everyone. No doubt he had called one of these kids' babysitters to come meet him for a game somewhere down south. It wouldn't take long for him to come get him and leave. When he returned he would try his lucky charms all over again. The bastards will get us every day if they want to but today's gonna be different. These things go back & forth between good times and bad times until something breaks. Something's gotta give tonight. I drove past the bus stop and parked in the parking lot of the Denny's across the street in case it gets rough but no need to worry about anything right now.

","There are many things worse than being a Vampire...there are few things worse than to be mistaken for one.

I had it happen twice already this year, and today was the worst yet. I swear these hunters get more persistent as time goes on...

To explain what happened: Today I went into my neighborhood store, which wasn't anything different from every other day of my life, except at some point they started to suspect me of hunting vampires.

The first time I went in, it was pretty casual conversation. They were all very curious about how I didn't run away or show any signs of violence when we spoke. Of course there was no way of explaining that...but there was certainly a lot they didn't know...which is why they let me walk home. On accident, mind you - I would have walked home in full light anyway if I could afford the gas. As they knew me and where I lived (for whatever reason), they just took off knowing I was safe. I think I scared the poor man before he could even scream. The second time? Oh brother....

It was a Tuesday. 9 AM. And a guy like me can't come out without seeing someone looking up his ass while I drive my little truck down Main Street. It felt weird walking down there as an almost perfect match dressed head-to-toe in black with my white coat and sunglasses pulled down so low people barely saw me at all. It's always like playing hide and seek with the world. Even then though, it seemed they did not see me until after their car passed by. A blue Honda Accord. Not exactly an everyday sight...and it didn't help that there was a guy standing at the street corner blocking traffic. No matter, none of them stopped, but he decided to stop his friend walking back and yell ""Hey!!! That dude in black is totally a vampire! Go tell your friend!!!!"" Sure enough, this made sure I was seen and I guess he got the attention because a couple came over and stared at me until I parked my car right next to him...so much staring was done. At the time, it was awkward as hell. Still it seems stupid now. Maybe even pathetic to do something like that unless it was planned. Like baiting a shark to death...the idiot probably never realised he was feeding bait instead of the actual prey. Which turned the scene to pure horror rather quickly. Because of course, it was obvious who the bait was. One less monster on this world would keep the numbers down somewhat. What choice did we really have?

They both ran toward me as fast as possible, yelling and swearing, trying to kill me before I could react. They were armed with silver guns though. Or swords. Either way, they were clearly capable of stopping me in cold blood. But alas, they forgot to take into account a small detail. A factor most monsters fail to remember, myself included. I am an expert marksman, not an assassin. My skills are far more useful in killing humans than dealing with the likes of us. If it were me versus either, I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to take the shot, or throw the knife. Only idiots would choose to die on my turf, however. They were running circles around the parking lot, drawing closer, closer...never actually firing. They must have thought I had left, but no such luck.

I reached down to my side pocket and retrieved the crossbow I kept in there. I waited till I heard the screams reach my ears before turning back towards the parking lot. When they had closed distance enough, they stopped again and fired. Unfortunately for them, this is my front yard. Not their own personal training ground. I caught six bullets before I moved, three in each hand. You can easily hear them crack across metal...they obviously weren't going to miss this opportunity to make themselves look better in a pathetic attempt to kill me so I turned my eyes toward them.

I swung on of my hands high and the crossbows flew over, ripping through their hearts, sending them sprawling on the sidewalk in agonizing pain. I grabbed the other crossbow in its place and aimed it at the closest of them, moving slowly forward, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. A greatsword fell from beneath him and the remaining bullet pierced him through the chest as he screamed wildly. The sounds of glass shattering rang throughout the night as I stomped forward, brandishing my weapon menacingly over his corpse. He tried to speak, to resist, to defend himself against his new destiny...I ended that with another spear aimed straight at his throat. His eyes bulged in terror and shock as the blade sliced clean through flesh and bone, sending him falling to the floor lifeless. Before leaving his body, he still gasped in surprise and pointed at me screaming to call backup...in vain, of course. There's a hundred reasons not to go into these alley ways late at night but the lack of daylight has been an issue lately. Some say it gets dark too soon...no wonder I enjoy darkness so much....because I live in one.

","It should have been obvious to him, then and there, as he was about to leave the office. If not already evident from earlier encounters that did not go his way or even if she had yet to catch him (on which we can ignore for now), he must have become aware that she was more than just one of these 'werewolves'. No no this woman would kill him before the end of any conversation unless...

He made sure to keep an eye on her. He never really thought much about it until later though. It felt almost normal as they passed by each other several times throughout the week, both working in their respective offices. This feeling is why when she got close enough to touch him at lunch break, he felt sick. She had noticed her target, quite literally through her senses and kept a very wide stance around those same spots that always happened to be occupied by me. She would stand outside my door most days with her back hunched so that I couldn't see her face, only her eyes and shoulders. Then, after work, the two crossed paths again in their hallways, each person turning away from the other when the other came near without even acknowledging them first or making any attempt at greetings or pleasantries as was customary among colleagues. He found himself growing curious as to what sort of monster she might have encountered in her travels across the country. Her scent began to fill the hall leading up to her own desk where his office lay. A deep earthy aroma of pine needles and decaying leaves was the dominant smell and followed by a subtle aroma that reminded him somewhat of iron filings mixed with sweet spices.

The man realized as he approached her desk that he hated having to look up to see another tall, slender woman ahead of him, especially since she seemed unbothered by his height, which also reached past his nose. The two stared into each others' hearts like two deer caught in headlights waiting for death to come sooner rather than later but neither wished to turn away either lest their desires be destroyed along with their fragile dignity. What transpired next was beyond simple politeness; they leaned in and kissed each other passionately amidst the stunned silence between them. And he realized that the moment that their lips met he saw not an earthly beauty but a magnificent demoness.

Only one person knows about them. They can make no other friends because the moment anyone finds out they will become immortal-vampires-for life and turn into undead monsters of flesh and blood with an unyielding appetite for fresh living flesh. No friend wants to risk that fate. And so the vampire lives alone, until he meets his death.

I think maybe I should just sit out there, let others handle things while they try. Then I can go watch to see how it plays out when more of us decide to join up.

And the humans aren't going to stop before long. Why bother trying anything when you have nothing to lose?

At first there wasn't really any trouble getting someone from this realm into mine. My domain was so vast that the difference between worlds and dimensions was difficult to tell these days. One moment a soul walked off the ground of the world it came from to another and the next day that person was somewhere very far away walking across the land of mine. They weren't aware something was different until it occurred. After several years they might notice or ask questions but I gave them such good reasons why it didn't matter they often decided it didn't even phase them. Of course, sometimes souls refused completely. Or they got wise enough to catch the signs. Those usually didn't make a good deal of sense anyway. Sometimes a new face showing up after three months. They never lasted too long but...

Sometimes they did get wise eventually and started figuring out some way to figure this thing out. Once I learned about some sort of strange artifact called ""Search"" in our domain and began adding little suggestions for the best path through which they might pass through without falling in with me. And then the big one happened. Some sort of ritual had been discovered where a man named Joseph Smith had convinced the majority of people he was talking to about something called ""God"". He went further in doing so than I'd imagined. I couldn't help but chuckle as I listened to millions of men believing in him blindly as if he hadn't tricked their gullible asses for generations before. It's amusing watching humanity fall for the same trick over and over again though I have said no more than that because I don't want anyone to know my true identity.

His work wasn't done but neither is mine. If I keep letting myself slip in anonymously I may get caught someday by my brothers. But I need this information to understand them better if I am going to take full advantage of their greatest power weapon, their arrogance!

","""That is an extremely effective lie!"" I say, my voice echoing inside all their devices around me as the young woman in front of me throws her arms up and lets out a triumphant yell. ""It's beautiful! You never cease to amaze me.""

The young man next to me looks confused for a second, but his eyebrows slowly begin to rise in surprise at this new found knowledge, as he rubs his brow. He smiles smugly as if he too has solved some grand conundrum of life and death. 

I turn away from them and laugh, feeling quite satisfied. All of these humans are so easily fooled, yet it is entertaining nonetheless. They are truly more like children than men when they succumb to my tricks. The sheer joy on their faces can bring tears to my eyes, but it's not something I often show off to my little plaything disciples.  To them though, it's always more satisfying than candy or food because one simple truth makes another liar grow envious. It only takes one small seed to grow into a mighty oak tree someday...

""Now, let's see just who's biggest friend they actually have here, hmm?"" I chuckle softly while rubbing behind the ears of the furry little creature before me as its ears twitch excitedly at the sound of my name. No matter how many times we repeat our shared secret, she seems more excited about saying her true feelings to him again and again each time it comes up. At first, I didn't understand why; surely, even I was smart enough to know her true feelings for him wouldn't be reciprocated. However, she insisted otherwise every single time she told me I'm right now, which made me suspicious for a moment before the last couple questions I had been asking myself got answered by none other than the same person beside me. My brain could never forgive itself for being so naive after centuries of existence. She knows, however, that I wasn't interested in learning her 'real' story but to keep her happy regardless if she knew what really happened between two souls. For decades, I'd gotten used to telling the same boring lie every single week. Now finally, the twist I'd been longing for started to take shape, creating a new kind of tension I never had before in this life.. I love playing games with the human race, and I will make no mistake - there will always be another game for us to play together.

As such, I am content to sit idly by and watch those few mortals stumble through the trials before me, wondering when I would get a chance to set things straight and tell them honestly just where I came from. There was an untold number of lives lost trying to escape reality or chase illusions. It always took a new trick by yours truly first until someone managed to find the real thing, though it seemed like only a select few were meant for greatness. Most of them didn't stand a single chance against me anyway. I felt terrible, knowing that most couldn't handle what I would pull out of my hat for an encore, although I could hardly deny any other option.

","""What do I do?""

I couldn't lie. I *needed* to know what to do, but no matter what the next few seconds would make me want... fuck this. A couple things were bad here and there over time, but nothing majorly significant (mostly just little annoyances). 20k words or so later, I was out for blood and ready to start wreaking some havoc on a global scale again. It wasn't my fault anyone started having their religion challenged. After all, if there is one thing I am good at, it's being manipulative.

Now everyone thought I was dead, which was pretty much the best thing. Not only did they not expect me back yet, but when people heard about all of the evil shit happening on a daily basis around the world, they were terrified. And guess what? Everyone else felt scared as well, because even though everyone hated what I had done, they still wanted my power back. ""If we kill him,"" they'd tell each other, ""we become stronger."" That kind of thinking was pretty much exactly what I needed right now. Nobody wants me back until something awful happens; nobody really notices when an asshole shows up.

As I continued watching news reports from multiple locations, another reporter shouted into his mic that he could actually see something strange flashing blue light behind the statue near Washington D.C.... and by then it didn't seem like that was going to be too far from where he lived. If he died, the rest of the reporters will follow. But alas, that never happened. The guy never died, instead he just ran off, afraid. Guess he found out I had come back early after all. Oh, sweet revenge. Time waits for no man!

This also gave me a new sense of direction. Maybe, just maybe, I'll need to go full crazy again and blow some minds once again to convince them I *am* still active and present. Hell, might be a bit more appropriate than before since people have forgotten me since those past events, but can't quite figure out why everything is acting so unusual lately. Hmm, wonder what secrets this guy knows that I dont? Might give them away on Twitter soon.. wait, twitter isn't allowed to get involved in politics anymore? Fuck. There goes my idea; oh well.

And there's plenty of other ways to bring chaos into the world - I could destroy the stock market tonight, cause a mass panic tomorrow and watch the markets fall. Or perhaps create a plague in South America and let someone spread it across Europe; I'm already imagining how many headlines would break. Who needs literal magic when you have free will?! Then again, that wouldn't cover much of the landmasses that don't follow me directly. I should probably check on my cult members first. They must be ecstatic! Perhaps write them back personally to let them know about their divine purpose, because without humans, hell doesn't run very long.

Nope, it seems these guys aren't happy about the news that there's now a greater threat. Oh well, shouldn't take long to put a word out. All these prophets, seers, and psychic readers must be thrilled to finally hear from *the end times.* Now, gotta choose who gets to report my death. No, not one person, several. My minions will help spread the news. This should be fun for a few weeks at least, although I doubt it'll last long. People forget easily. Still, may as well enjoy myself while I have it. These days everyone thinks they can stand up to me; let's show them where their true strength lies. Screw the whole god-of-lies business, I'm taking down the entire damn multiverse next!

The government has given up all hope for surviving the apocalypse and closed off the borders preventing any outside parties or help while they wait for their end to come. However what they did not expect was the call coming in from an unknown source, calling out the name ""Odessey"" as a beacon that there was salvation on the way...

Meanwhile thousands of miles away, somewhere far beyond space where no man has tread, sits the Odessey Space Station watching Earth fade into nothingness along with its inhabitants, it waits patiently for its final destination: The Starborn world, named by those who knew the location, Andromeda.  Its crew is excited because once they arrived there they will finally be home, knowing nothing of what awaits them yet.

It started in low pitch but then slowly crescendoed into the most perfect tones you'd ever heard.  A symphony unlike anything you'd seen. You felt almost like you were going to cry just listening.

""What would you want?"" It asked. 

Well shit now that I think about it...how does one answer?   Do aliens know what we're talking about when we talk to them?

We were at war, and even though we already won, it did not mean that all was over. No war can really end until every battle has been fought and won on some battlefield, no matter how big or small.

In my view of history, I'm surprised we never knew aliens sooner, if they do exist. They would surely be somewhere in space by now, and probably doing exactly what other beings do. As far as wars go, this one seemed the best chance that something like this could go wrong, seeing as the stakes are relatively low (humans vs. aliens), but everything else about it seems too high risk for its own good. I know I should be grateful that we managed to win before things got out of hand for us, given how much less powerful aliens may actually be compared to humans, there might be more ways for them to exploit this situation. 

But for me it didn't count for anything since the result doesn't get me any closer to being happy, because honestly there's just too much death involved. If aliens have come here, then we are doomed whether we destroy one another or not. Either way we can expect worse than Earthly war and destruction; instead of weapons and soldiers from both sides taking their toll we have something so much more horrible: time itself. Time travel.

We'd sent ships out to every star system with the intent of searching for life... but nobody responded and when asked how they are doing I always replied ""Just fine"" with a smile on my face as I choked down a sob so quiet nobody was going to hear it until years later people were coming forward with stories. So many were never returned but those that came back told amazing tales: new civilizations full of wonder and beauty who found what mattered more than anything else. Those messages did not tell much, or often, anything at all and so they just got ignored by scientists and politicians alike until one day this young girl got into her rocket ship after some time alone in isolation to discover these incredibly advanced beings from which she learned much. These aliens told us where all the great ancient sites of history were--the pyramids and sphinx weren't actually built so much as placed and hidden--and then gave us information about their own history. We made our way there, travelled through wormholes and portals from dimension to dimension. It took centuries to get there but it was worth it. When we finally reached the destination we encountered nothing--not even the signs of the civilization. And there we saw something incredible. It was like a doorway. An entrance/exit to dimensions beyond our comprehension. The portal was open--a gate that let you go anywhere without having to find your way back. But it remained closed and no one could use it nor could anyone enter the other side.

","The glass was thick enough to prevent the sound of my scream from getting out. That's the only thing I can be grateful for right now. I don't know how long it took me, but after what seemed like an eternity I finally managed to throw the knife with enough force to impale someone, though judging by that faint red stain on its sharp tip, something didn't quite go as planned.

In the distance, a man dressed in a leather-like suit and sunglasses could be seen looking around desperately. What little light there was inside our apartment wasn't helping much. Just as he entered my line of sight, we both froze, waiting for whatever would come next. 

His expression went cold, the last trace of fear being swept away with a determined glint in his eyes. You see, this man never even needed to get closer for him to kill me. He threw the bottle directly at my neck before I could move an inch. In all honesty, no amount of practice would have helped in my case. When a blade gets embedded so deeply into your flesh, one can't easily pull it out. 

If I hadn't been too stunned by how easy the task had proven to be, I might have started screaming; instead all that came out was a moan and a groan as I laid on the ground, watching life drain out of my body as the bullet hit me square between the knees. My vision blurred as the room swayed. The sounds started warping: voices talking behind black walls, laughter echoing through emptiness, music that reminded me of home...but only a little bit.

","I had been practicing my Rock Paper Scissors for ages when a dark shadow passed by me and stole my light. I stood there at first shocked that someone would dare to steal my light, but as I looked around the darkness to see why no one was there...

But then I did. The most stupid thing ever. Someone with hair like mine who wore an old worn out coat walked up to the window and shined his shoe lights on me. It was like he knew I lost my shine too. He chuckled to himself as I stared ahead without realizing the time, but it didn't matter now. I threw my hands up and shouted ""ROCK!"" Then something very strange happened. My hand was being held together in the air before anyone else could react and I suddenly felt pain shoot through every part of my body, even though they said that if rock beat paper, scissor wins. Whatever that means. That isn't the strangest though. As we stand back up from our shock, the man took a step closer and looked down at me and spoke in a voice so beautiful, so sweet, that I swear my breath stopped for 10 seconds. Before I knew it, he wrapped me into his arms and kissed me passionately. In the middle of a hallway full of men staring in horror. Once I broke away, I saw what really drew the crowd's attention: I became the object of interest. Apparently I have some mysterious magic power. Some think I can kill people based on my looks. Others think I can change their minds and manipulate them. None of those things are true thankfully.

The man told me more about the rules of this place and what kind of person he thought I am. According to him, everyone here has powers in different forms of ways and there's only three paths we can choose, good, evil or neutrality. The man pointed out that I must be trying hard not to chose Evil as I seem to struggle to maintain composure. After he explained everything I finally realized where I was: A popular highschool called 'Academy of Supernatural Ability'. We sat across from each other at the cafeteria talking while all the students around us try to get over to talk with me.

""It's over, bitch,"" he said mockingly, ""rock!""

My eyes widened. I wanted to say something to dissuade him, plead with him, beg him to end this horrible nightmare--but what could I say? I had lost everything I cared about and loved, it wasn't much to ask for. All there was left was hope for forgiveness from heaven, but in all honesty, how can one be forgiven for being a murderer! It was murder no matter where or how you did it. At least try to live out the rest of your life without ever committing another crime again. But if someone committed so many crimes before death came to their door then surely they deserved to die. 

""Don't fucking lie to me. You always do this shit to me."" He laughed at this, it was almost unbearable for me because his laughter sounded exactly like mine now. Then he broke the mirror and we both ran toward each other fists up ready to fight--it was a war of justice: revenge upon my enemy. His fist connected first with a loud smack hitting my temple. My vision began to blur and I felt myself faint. Then there was nothing.  

As soon as I woke up I could barely make out images in front of me, a few pieces of glass reflecting off of some form or something which reminded me very little of anything I knew. When my image moved away I suddenly realized that it must have been the only thing standing between my soul and the abyss. For just when he died, I also died: or maybe we died together. We are both the same person and after centuries of reincarnation and past lives the two souls finally found each other again and will never truly see each other again until we reunite in hell--or purgatory or heaven--who knows!

Everyone says that if you've seen your mom, then you can escape. And no one had escaped since she came to this place - except now. He knew. I tried very hard to stop thinking about her, couldn't even think of her half the time. Every other minute the faces would flash in front of my eyes: mine and hers. My brother standing next to me, his hands shaking in fear; he was so small looking, barely old enough to play hopscotch with me on the sidewalk outside our home; the smell of strawberry ice cream and cherry blossom trees in his hair; how many years until he was big enough to drive and tell me about his dreams; how many years until I met his girlfriend and he introduced me; how many days left until my father walked through the door, kissed me on the cheek and said goodbye. How many minutes left until Mom's arms were around me again. And every second that passed felt like centuries because of how much time remained until I got free. When you've lived like this for so long you hate those days that feel like forever and years that feel like hours.

But instead of continuing the test he rushes me through it saying it is time I return with the others and that this one has already taken care of it. I leave without saying goodbye. Something tells me the test has a tiebreaker now and he thinks he has found a solution. Whatever it was, it worked anyway. That means he was wrong.

One thing had been consistent, the fact that no one else was around. My wife was still alive, though I doubted anyone ever actually knew I had a wife. If I hadn't gotten married to my wife before, she wouldn't have come around anyway. Then again I wasn't sure why she came to live with us, as far as I knew, nobody told her how to end up marrying me. 

Of course she came along anyway, and we'd grown old together. We were sitting here talking like nothing had changed, maybe a few decades later. This is going well though, good lord where is the rest of the plot...?



EDIT: 4 Months Later



""What is wrong with your hair!?"" yelled the editor over the phone. 

I don't have much time to respond.  This was happening faster than any other place I visited. In each iteration of this story, the more words I used, the less time I seemed to spend on each single world. For example, after four chapters of describing the setting and history, I spent two days, twenty four hours each. It didn't matter, because I kept going till a random event happened

Once the first chapter goes up on the internet, I know that it ends, whether it is another hundred thousand pages or none. Because now someone wants to read more. My publisher will probably see enough sales, not enough for anything, but enough to convince the editor to stop pushing me and letting me continue what should have been a very short project

I am tired right now, but I cannot possibly stop until they pick up our latest tale. 


For example, I guess I must say hi from Mars again. And it doesn't take long. Maybe fifteen minutes each time I arrive somewhere. By the time I return its late and im exhausted...



They might think this a bad idea - after all I've written about. That the stories won't change, and they haven't. Until recently. I'll start getting bored soon, yeah. But no - *we're* going to make this work

The room hums with soft white light, giving everything an unrealizable serenity. 
And through that window, my father stands and looks upon his own son.

My name is Edward Stark, and I stand beside him, my hand on the blade.

My sister walks past the window, smiling. Her name is Beth, and she looks quite beautiful. She asks me why Im doing it. How long til I die. How much longer must I suffer the indignity of life, without death bringing a solution to this impossible situation.

I dont know what answer would satisfy her. Neither does Edward. Why are we standing here, staring out at our fathers corpse? Where did we grow up again. My face, and mine alone remains unchanged, but hers is younger, softer, and full of hope. She smiles again, and says her mother would be proud of her sons decision.

My body trembles violently, as tears stream down my face. There are few sounds around us except the crackling of twigs burning beneath the embers of the fire pit below us. Our dad's carcass lies broken upon the ice, and the cold bite of winter clings tenaciously to my bones.  I lift my hand, trembling, and touch the hilt of the obsidian blade clasped in my fingers. The coldness is alien to my hands, strange to calloused skin. 

I raise the weapon high above my shoulder, but my eye meets that of my daughter. Her lips move, whispering a wordless prayer. Only her husband, her brother, their children survive the next day. Their corpses, unidentifiable, disappear down the road as winter closes in. No, they do not survive. It is clear that they did not even know when to fall to the floor in their fear - if the blade strikes deep enough, I doubt we all shall be left intact.

A tear slips down her cheek as she drops her gaze, wiping it away with a thin arm. 
""Forgive me Father,"" she whispers, looking back to meet mine. ""Father forgive me.""

Tears well up in my eyes as I bring the blade close against my throat and plunge it deep into the fleshy gash I saw earlier. I do not cry. There is only relief, now that the pain returns to my skin; I do not feel afraid anymore, and instead the sensation is sweet, like chocolate dipped strawberries melting slowly between my fingertips. 

A shiver runs down my spine as the air shimmers around me. I watch as a wave of heat ripples outward from my neck, radiating warmth throughout the entire frozen meadow where I stand. My heart beats loud and proud, strong and healthy.

","He fell asleep. 

""I'm sorry, I must have fallen asleep again."" The words tumbled through his mouth as he sat slumped over his keyboard, eyes half closed and fingers typing furiously despite it becoming increasingly obvious that not a single thought was going to come forth. He wanted desperately for something new to show up in his document and after days of hard work on this story; he wished it was here. What kind of story is this? A post-apocalyptic thriller? An intergalactic mystery? No...nothing came to mind. This had been an endless loop ever since he began drafting this book five months ago, with very little progress made other than rewrites from beginning to end because some plot details didn't seem quite right or could be rewritten more eloquently.

As quickly as a breeze blowing across his face in the dead of winter, he snapped himself awake and grabbed his paper cup with coffee left in it to gulp down every last drop before setting it next to the garbage can. He glanced at the computer and saw what it was: it was still open as usual but when he clicked back in it showed nothing except a white screen and he cursed under his breath as if to apologize to whatever evil entity has conspired against him. ""Shit"" he cried out loud enough for no one else to hear then grabbed his phone, ready to start posting his woes on the Internet. Maybe he could just get someone to do it instead. 

His first response was met with the same prompt for logging in so he moved on. Another comment on another website soon caught his attention - that of Reddit. Someone there must know how to fix his problems and he was sure it would work perfectly. Sure, there were always people giving advice everywhere, all the time. Still, most of them talked too much about their own feelings like no one asked. So far though, everyone seemed to agree that getting his software working wouldn't hurt anyone and that he should never give up writing. That was exactly what he needed. After being rejected by several agents and publishers who said that his books weren't good enough - ""too technical for your target market"", ""no emotional connection"", etc., it really did feel like quitting hadn't even been worth considering. But lately he had gotten better with it...and his agent just wasn't replying to emails anymore! Damn bastard had probably gotten sick and forgot that he even replied the day before, so now his inbox was flooded with responses to messages he sent days prior. Not only that, it felt like everyone around him knew where everything went wrong with his manuscripts and tried to help him. Hell yeah. There might be something new after all: someone finally gets what it's like to write fantasy. Finally.

The writer slammed his laptop shut, gave it a long stare down and slapped the desk beside him. Nothing changed; damn thing still refused to boot up without prompting any sort of password. ""I wish you'd worked harder with this program,"" he grumbled and shook the keys as he threw the notebook onto the couch, kicking it aside, cursing. Everything must be glitching somewhere. That stupid door lock wasn't responding to his hand either so he turned away and stomped upstairs to unlock it - maybe there was a problem there. The moment he opened his bedroom door however, he noticed a weird light coming from the closet and immediately realized that there wasn't anything familiar there. He decided to grab a blanket anyway because shit, that must have been the air conditioner and quickly changed clothes before slipping underneath the sheets and attempting to relax. Yeah, everything seemed fine - lights were off, windows are shut so no drafts should cause problems. Or should it?

The sudden creak of wood outside jolted him awake. What was that noise? It was definitely not his house. In fear of running downstairs (he had tripped over something before), he cautiously crept out of bed. All he could see was the outline of the front yard lit by moonlight which he had forgotten was still flooding out due to the heavy duty curtains covering up the window shades. Oh god, shit. Of course my house has these damned things blocking my view and blinds cutting off my sight at night. It makes sense why nobody responds to him anymore: Nobody wants to read his book after realizing it's basically a dark dungeon crawl set in a creepy maze with no hope of escaping. 

Then something strange occurred. He thought it was a crow, sitting precariously on the roof at the entrance to his yard but something didn't look right with it. He approached from behind it so he could get a closer look but suddenly felt something solid hit its skull, knocking it unconscious. Looking around, he found two shadows looming over him and yelling incoherently, screaming at him until finally they spoke. Something along the lines of ""YOU CAN TELL US HOW YOU GOT HERE AND WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING OVER THERE"". Now he looked closer and saw what must have caused the shadow to jump over the roof. There were bats. Hundreds of them, swarming around the structure and looking menacingly at him. His heart raced. If he got stepped on, it'll be game over. 

From the corner of his eye, he saw something move beneath him and froze. Was it me? Had someone crawled in through the vent? Taking advantage of his momentary lack of awareness, the figure shot forward and sunk its teeth into his arm. He shrieked, falling backwards and smashing against the wall as pain exploded across his body. As he landed on the ground, more of the creatures followed. He scrambled backward in terror, slamming on the floor and pulling away frantically from the attack - it bit hard. His screams became muffled cries as he stumbled toward his bedroom door and flung it open, hoping to make a run for it as he desperately searched his pockets for the keys but none were present. He pulled them from the side of his shirt trying to claw his way towards the bathroom before stopping himself in an instant upon hitting his knees, stumbling into the hallway instead. This wasn't even worth fighting - those bat bastards took off.

","""I wish I'd waited,"" I said, flipping away from the 911 operator and over to my boyfriend. We were a mile above sea level in a helicopter that was descending quickly for a reason we weren't exactly sure of.

The rotor blades roared. ""What's wrong?"" he asked me. ""You didn't warn me.""

""It looks like some kind of meteor or meteorite is headed straight at us,"" the pilot radioed in before dropping his voice to almost an inaudible murmur.

My ears are ringing now, but my vision isn't blurry yet, so I can barely process anything except what's right in front of me: myself and Michael, sitting opposite each other on a single leather armchair with matching orange covers and an almost identical posture. In front of us sat two wooden tables that held mugs of tea. The room seems familiar but strangely blank.

In fact, it's just as I had imagined when I first started this story about six weeks ago. Just hours before I fell asleep - after a late-night phone call - and then dreamt of being here for some reason.

My husband had warned me not to fall asleep at the keyboard. I told him I wouldn't and was only halfway through my novel. How could any person be that distracted, right? Wrong. Sometimes you have to take mental breaks to fully imagine the story coming to life, no matter how much you think you already know it. And tonight I decided, because it wasn't really necessary to finish the book tomorrow, that my story could come alive today. That I should just stop, let the characters breathe. To hell with finishing the novel next morning, maybe someone would pick it up, edit it, publish it... I don't care, there was nowhere I'd rather live than in this cozy little cabin than this hotel where I met my true love. Who would have thought I'd ever get this lucky? It looked very luxurious, especially in comparison to our dingy apartment back home, although I suppose both homes couldn't compete with this one. A few times in the past I had seen people reading these books, holding their breath as if waiting for something bad to happen, hoping something interesting or funny would happen. All of those times was actually happening right in front of my eyes; right on this table by my bedside. What did they expect to see? Was there an episode that didn't turn out quite the way it was intended? What about the characters that didn't appear at all? Maybe some ghost readers had written in some things themselves, thinking they'd leave nothing behind for others to discover. Perhaps even the plot was different, without me noticing or acknowledging what changes had been made.

But there was only one thing left to change, and I found myself wondering whether I could do it alone or if I needed help. If I didn't complete the story, will anyone continue it? Do I know too much and ruin the mystery? Or better still, am I going to find some clues in this empty house and try to figure everything out on my own?

And why did I decide to wake up at the time I did? The ending should feel satisfying, but that may not be the case. I felt like I needed to make it exciting, like a rollercoaster of emotions where things happened suddenly and unexpectedly, rather than slowly unfolding over several chapters. You never want your reader to forget what the story is all about; what the characters stand for, what they hope to achieve, where they need to end up, who everyone expects to die (and who doesn't). You also want to avoid getting stuck on certain paths and missing out on other opportunities, the ones that might surprise your reader and keep them guessing until the bitter end. You need conflict, romance, suspense, action - and none of these things necessarily go hand in hand! So I began to think about the best course of events, which elements to include and how to present them. There was a lot to consider, even though things weren't very clear in my mind when I closed my eyelids and surrendered myself to sleep. 



Now that I think about it more deeply, I can certainly make these changes myself.

","I opened my eyes to see a large, stone castle before me, a gate stood ahead and I felt a weight pulling at me...but whatever it was holding me there, it was letting go now....and with that weight came the ability to move.

A wave of confusion washed over me, everything seemed so vast but yet nothing made sense...there was just something about this place that reminded me of home. The weather was perfect; warm and bright in the mid-day sun and there was no smoke or smog to be found, if anything you could hear birds singing through every grove near out door trees which made their way across the fields of grass. 

I looked down at myself and saw that I wasn't wearing any clothes because all I knew how to do at this moment was breathe I tried walking through a small grove I remembered thinking ""Hmm why did I put the fence around a tree when the rest of the forest behind it isn't guarded?"" ...well I walked right on through it but only got to walk three feet past the fence. It was now clear that not all guards would protect these walls for free. A few soldiers had noticed me and I could hear an armored knight talking amongst his men in hushed tones: he asked where they should send him...they wanted to send their best guard but he didn't want to as it might seem like too much work after what happened to another man sent up ahead. 

He decided to try another route as he saw the armor that covered the other soldier's body as if being eaten by hungry insects crawling away from blood in a puddle beneath the dead man. 
""Ughhhhh...."" 

*sigh* Ok! What will it be then? Just send someone quick they'll think we are going full bore towards them if they don't know were ready anyway, we can never catch up either way. If we waited they probably had already taken our supplies they have some horses tied up near here somewhere.*he said this aloud knowing its unnecessary for anyone else but himself to hear it. He grabbed one sword strapped onto his waist and took a look at his shield with the black wolf on it and started trotting toward the town slowly. When he reached the wall he stopped motioning off in silence with his hand raised high. 
""Hmph."" 

They both nodded and I went through the doors of the castle. After that he turned again as his mouth fell agape in shock, though whether shocked surprised confused bewildered or happy I couldn't say.

My heart began to race as if I didn't have a heartbeat left in me. It is very frightening for an individual who hasn't experienced this condition before. 

""We need you out of here. You'll be better soon. We're taking care of everything."" He said as he stood up. ""It won't last long. The surgery is quick and painless.""

A feeling of relief washed over me; why were they talking like that? What did they mean by ""everything?"" My eyes focused onto him, not knowing what else to do. My mouth began trembling again as I spoke in what I remembered to be one word at time ""Surgery? What are you talking about?""

The guy chuckled and put his hands in the air to show he wasn't being funny. ""You went under but our staff made sure there was only pain for 5-10 minutes on purpose, or you could ask them why they gave you anesthesia right now...""

It's eventually found out that time travel is impossible to any point before the ability to time travel is discovered. So no going back 5 minutes in the first time machine. Tell how the ability to time travel is discovered.","There had been countless scientists who, armed with their best thinking and a handful of the world’s greatest minds, had tried for decades to crack the code to time travel.  Most had given up after only months trying.

I was one of those people, at least until I came across an ancient Aztec manuscript at my university archives. Written on papyrus in Elvish, but not as spoken by any known language: it was written like a language from the Earth of another dimension, or perhaps more accurately, a parallel Earth. There were pictures that could be translated into other languages using this strange Elvish tongue, most likely used by a race we knew nothing of. And what’s more; many pages contained very complex equations, which seemed familiar yet alien. Like they should’ve belonged elsewhere, maybe from some other dimension...

“Are you sure about this?” asked Dr. Olaus, frowning. The rest of our colleagues at the research center frowned with him; though he’d finally agreed to let us continue investigating, there hadn’t been much enthusiasm involved. We were now gathered over a thousand meters beneath New York City - probably an earthquake created a cave system big enough to house us and allow for experiments like this. A few of the earth’s strongest nuclear magnets lined up along the far end of the tunnel to prevent possible collapsing ground around us. They were just holding us here against all odds right now. Why was this such a high priority? In the grand scheme of things the answers weren’t really clear yet. But all those years of work and we might have cracked one of the great mysteries; Time Travel.

That’s when everything went wrong.

The earth under our feet vibrated, then shook violently as massive earthquakes rattled and rocked our makeshift habitat. It was an earthquake of unimaginable force. All hell broke loose inside the cavern; rocks began falling; walls gave way as fissures appeared throughout the tunnels that we’d thought would keep our little party safe. The ground above fell through and swallowed our building whole, leaving us stranded miles below ground level. And even as they struggled for air we heard the echoes of our screams for help swallowed by the immense rockfall. No signals were made contact - communication channels fell silent after sending the message “we need immediate assistance! We’re trapped!”

With the facility gone nothing stood between me and the vast unknown beyond the hole we’d fallen through. If we made a run for it there wasn’t anything stopping us...well except that everyone else was dead. Except for me.


""Shit."" Said a voice behind me, ""Why are we still standing?""



I turned around. Everyone else lay dead or gravely wounded, and the only person alive was a scientist I couldn't recognize. What surprised me more than her dark blue hair and green eyes was what she was wearing: a tattered tuxedo suit accented with silver trim. The head had also been shaved close to the skin. The woman said nothing, just stared ahead. Her expressionless face took away some of the tension but the sight still set my heart racing. Was she the villain, or just confused? After a moment passed, she spoke. She called herself Anya. She explained that when the machine malfunctioned, instead of simply creating a portal to someone specific she accidentally brought the entirety of the universe to a single location. 
A space that doesn’t exist… Or at least didn’t beforehand. And she needed to find a way to get them home.

We had five minutes until the universe collapsed around us if we didn’t cooperate. Of course, the fact that every being in existence appeared in front of us was rather concerning. Not to mention the fact that there were numerous beings here we could call intelligent life: animals as well as humans who walked among us day in and day out. Now these beings appeared from nowhere, staring directly at us with expressions that varied in interest/curiosity/terror and shock. I guess she forgot something.



Well either way Anya wanted someone to do what I did; get her back to where she belonged. But how could anyone possibly do that? I mean we all died. That was literally the case- we looked death in the face and came back. And what happens next? Does the universe cease to be? Well she decided to leave me in charge so i told her that we must find out exactly how this happened. At the same time we decided that while waiting for whatever answer Anya had prepared may come we could look for solutions: science shouldn’t be limited to a certain point and time, why couldn’t we study it forever. Maybe I wouldn’t have to worry about the impending doom of annihilation for today—or tomorrow for that matter..

If only we’d listened when our heads started hurting slightly....

The concept seems rather whimsical at best, and almost as dangerous as science fiction stories depict it.

When I came across a random web search while browsing one day (and thusly discovered Reddit) for ways people think that space-time could be bent around them, but nothing seemed useful or even remotely plausible until i ran across this question: ""What if you had a way to alter something within your past?""... so simple, yet it immediately made sense! It only makes so much more sense when looked at now.

If i knew everything was just lines of code and our world was ultimately nothing more than data on servers, why couldn't we erase things off those servers? Why couldnt we pull them out like books from shelves with some magic software? A perfect example is what most consider the biggest event of human history, the assassination of JFK! Did he have anything to do with making his country into the dystopia we all know today? Was it Nixon that killed him? Or maybe Lee Harvey Oswald working for the CIA? If it were truly possible to rewrite the timeline then, why did they decide against doing so? Why choose to keep his murder on record as an unsolved mystery after Kennedy died? To the best of my knowledge every theory put forward still has flaws in it.. except for one that stood out amongst all others. No one ever talks about it really, so i thought why bother telling anyone.. there will never be proof of it anyway.. the truth will likely remain hidden forever by the powers that be. But it would give me chills thinking about it. We aren't alone. There are aliens among us, living their lives right now and they watch us. For centuries now they have looked upon us with disgust, disgusted with the things we chose to do, which led to the ultimate death of Jesus Christ and thus bringing about the start of mankind's current age of depravity.

To make matters worse, these aliens, despite their advanced technology, lack faith and morals. All they want is to get what they need and then disappear. When the earth was ready to receive its second savior in the form of man, God sent Jesus, expecting salvation of a far greater level than man. These aliens saw it as blasphemy and decided not to intervene. This is where things fall apart. Because of our greed, violence, lust, pride, sloth, envy, wrath and pride; we failed Jesus. He died on a cross, unable to forgive himself for saving mankind from destruction when he was supposed to live on and guide us through the Dark Ages, to bring forth the light again. And guess what happened when his mission failed because of him? Our planet descended into utter darkness for over 10 centuries, without sunlight. Imagine living with zero light for over 10 years each night? How would you survive? What effect would it have on your body? Your mental state? You cannot escape your physical state at all, you can only change your thoughts.

As if this wasn't already terrible enough, what else did these extraterrestrial beings decide? That man is no match for them anymore.. In exchange for granting them free reign over us, they promised to save us once more. They have a long list of evil acts and atrocities they committed, and they don't have another hundred lifetimes left over to fulfill their promises.. They wanted to test man's moral and ethical compass by making their home planet destroyed, forcing man to die out. Not wanting to lose a chance at freedom here, they asked for an ultimatum: either send them away or perish from existence, they didn't care about our petty disputes amongst ourselves, just kill us out completely if we refuse their offer. With everyone dead or having disappeared long ago into the dark void beyond Earth; the last remaining alien civilization takes control of Earth. From whatever remnants remain they rebuild themselves as a government, deciding to continue what they began nearly 200 years ago - take away humans' freedoms until they submit. This is why every person here should ask one question: are you serving the interests of yourself above other humans, the common good, or the benefit of all humans together with yourselves?

A single paragraph about some strange calculations he was working on that somehow led him into Einstein and his special relativity equations, the one thing that really got this whole scientific endeavor off the ground, *wink*

""Professor Einsenith, your work has always impressed me,"" Von Braun wrote to his employer, ""you may not agree with my ideas, but I know what I have here will change everything.""  

Dr. Oppenheimer had been skeptical at best and was never interested in listening but when the results came back showing that something quite interesting did indeed appear in the calculations, *not just an equation, a physical representation of time as well* Dr. Opperheimer changed his tune somewhat. The next month or so is fairly unremarkable until October rolls around and Von Braun approaches Oppenheimer for one last meeting. He says there is one more result that makes sense with what he presented previously. **[insert funny quote/image depicting time travelling Von Braun explaining a concept\]

This second paper shocked everyone in Europe and further fueled their desire to achieve it by building their own contraptions. In Germany scientists were extremely excited because they saw the promise that would come with such technology, however the Germans only cared about its application toward warfare and nuclear fission and ignored many others. On November 8th, 1946 Nazi leader Adoph Hitler called a meeting in Berlin with the heads of his most trusted physicists. The room was filled with men who would be responsible for developing this device, a few months after this meeting Hitler commits suicide and dies shortly thereafter. It wasn't long after that this team was disbanded, or worse, was arrested by Allied forces for war crimes and treason. No matter where you were stationed during the war, someone wanted to get on top of time while still alive. Some succeeded and left this earth, others couldn't find another one, but those who succeeded continued making progress. As the years pass, though humanity knows of it, nobody has gone back yet. 


**What does it mean? If we go back in time can we rewrite our history and make sure that the Allies won during WW2 thus removing us from danger? Or do the timelines divergently and become multiple universes? Does the future actually exist? And if it does does time travel mean that every decision we make leads to a new timeline? What else could it lead too? Is there even a real past or are we living as people in another dimension? Can we control time travel? When will it be possible to return to that very specific moment where you fell asleep yesterday or that awkward party your friend gave without knowing that it will turn into a joke years later? Has anyone tried? Why haven't there been any other temporal anomalies detected? Oh wait, why didn't anybody ever tell that man standing here that things like this don't go through in the same way the movie shows? Now things seem obvious and easy - everybody knows that this happened already - if they didn't exist then they wouldn't be able to go back, but they would need some kind of time displacement device. But surely there weren't enough resources in that small country alone and besides Germany has been defeated. They probably blew up all of the equipment! We live forever in an era of infinite time, shouldn't we be trying to kill ourselves right now and stop ruining Earth? It seems too obvious now, doesn't it? Well yes, it is obvious that it would be better to just die and save time on the rest of it! However there's some little part of that small percentage of humanity that wants to see what happens, what wonders might lie beyond tomorrow, beyond next week, beyond the year 3000. Nobody thinks they'll ever see anything past today. How old did you look in your head the day you died? What seemed real? What will this feeling of being truly happy bring you upon finding immortality? Will it ever vanish? It seemed so simple, so profound! What did time tell you? Did it keep it secret from you? Why? Because it's fun isn't it? You thought all of these mysteries would make life worthwhile and that perhaps you were destined to be important. To go back again and again, and live and learn, explore and meet heroes and villains, fight good and evil and build empires and lose them and start over all over again with new friends and enemies and family, maybe falling in love and heartbreak. Maybe seeing death itself and understanding what it means to be human. But the true mystery is why people aren't doing this now.]]

When time travel became possible, however, nobody understood the full extent of what it meant. No one knew where you could go nor for how long. Some think that the universe holds billions of dimensions all of which are parallel worlds mirroring each other or creating a sort of multiverse, but all are unaware how the connection works or where exactly the portal lays between. For time traveler Thomas E. Smith, timetravel was nothing but science and speculation. Not much of a fan of big-ideas and big ambitions he enjoyed solving problems rather than grand conspiracies. That was also one problem he loved. A seemingly random collection of numbers, letters, mathematical notations and algorithms and cryptic symbols - to the majority of readers; those who knew the meaning behind such a string, could only feel the urge to grab that book from the library shelf - the pages containing a complex formula written in a language so alien, unlike anything mankind has encountered: the language of Time Travel. All that time went into planning the trip and finally after countless failed attempts, Thomas managed to put all the pieces together and create the universal time translator that read and translated the message in the books code. The journey took several days and despite the tedious process, Thomas remained calm and collected throughout. Once finished he closed the book after having reread it through once and looked at it through the translators lens. After carefully aligning himself to the position indicated within the textbook and closing both eyes, he pressed the red button placed above the text that would activate the Translator and began to watch as lines of light danced across his desk screen and faded away. The image displayed on the screen showed the world he had chosen decades prior. At first it was beautiful; a sprawling metropolis bathed in sunshine and glowing orange sunset lights illuminating the futuristic skyline above him. Slowly he saw that it hadn't turned the way he imagined, it stood still, frozen like a statue, unable to move, still as glass and unchanging in beauty. Confused, perplexed, overwhelmed, he turned away from the video and attempted to close his eyes and dream about the night, hoping that it would transport him to some fantastic place. Instead he awoke inside a lab on a cold steel table, surrounded by wires attached to every inch of his body. The wires emitted a faint hum. Through a slight crack in the wall, he could faintly hear voices murmuring in Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish. Finally opening his eyes, he realized it was all made of ice. Each piece of furniture, clothing, even the metal tables and chairs were all covered in thin sheets of ice. The air tasted bitter as it was cold and humid and the sound of water dripping everywhere around him sent shivers down his spine. It didn't take long before someone burst out from the shadows and shouted ""you've done it!!!"" and picked him up, dragging him forward towards the source of the voice. It was a woman dressed in a white uniform with her face hidden behind a helmet resembling Mr. Spock's mask. Thomas looked through his binoculars and realized that she was holding a large sword pointing directly at him.

[removed]","I've heard stories about being scared of death, but I can assure you my only fear is that they won't find it yet.

It had been 275 years since the original Death brought us peace with an end to war and poverty after he offered a deal: no more violence, and all will go smoothly for everyone else so long as we are nice to him on his walk through every graveyard on Earth at least once a week. With that said, not much has changed on the human front save that now humans don't fight each other anymore, which, while good for me was terrible when he came to power because I never made any friends, and just kept having nightmares over them. So naturally I tried to get rid of him. That was stupid, of course, since he got into heaven by accident and took the entire concept of hell with him! And now that there is literally nothing left to do here other than pray to this god-awful angel like creature (he still hasn't gotten back) that would come down here with his annoying music or something and then go around trying to make men look like women.

But whatever. Onwards to his point: after going out again yesterday and finding a small church with some really nice folk inside, I did what I came here for--I asked him why he couldn't give up. They called him 'the Angel', which isn't right, mind you, because he doesn't deserve credit when he can just be forgiven. He explained that everything people have ever done was important, even if it seems like it wasn't to themselves, to another person at one time or another. Because when we die, it's only *our* soul that dies off. Everything else comes along with that too! The Bible says so! We need to remember that this place is far away from where we started life. This place is eternal bliss, a reward for working our hardest to do things correctly. It could be anyone's.

""There's still bad in the world."" I say, ""You know. You see all these happy families in the middle of a war. Why? Is it wrong to be angry? Or sad?""

A very loud and ugly thing flies past me as though through air while I speak. I think it must be his way of saying yes. No? He makes a sound then proceeds to shove me roughly back towards the crowd of praying people looking upon a screen showing an empty chair.

""No,"" I say, ""This seat has a big heart. A very big heart, full of happiness, probably better than anything in this whole place. Maybe your biggest fans are in the clouds above. I mean who else does a live TV broadcast while standing in a grave, watching thousands and thousands of people who aren't dead yet wish that were dead because it might bring their loved ones back?

He looked up from the ground, sitting on a park bench. He hadn't been back here in ages, but he did like coming down to his old town every now and then. And this time, the one thing that had kept him alive long enough until now, seemed as though it might be taking him too... even for him. It felt unreal how empty everything around him was compared to a few months ago. 

It could be bad if he didn't find something soon. That is, assuming there really *was* something. His phone vibrated once more as he opened an email on his laptop and scrolled through its contents. The only messages were reminders to call and text his family, friends, and girlfriend (he missed them all dearly). There was also a message from someone new. A name that wasn't anyone he knew - no company info either. ""How do you feel?"" it said simply. Almost out of malice, but with genuine interest nonetheless. Even after the year he'd gone through, it was nice that someone would want to know whether or not he cared, so... Maybe I should give him a shot...?

It was a stupid idea that had died an even stupider death: In the beginning of one lifetime they were married, by time the end came all alone he would be dead and so his wife committed suicide as well to make things more than a bit sadistic. That kind of thing works for horror-lovers but Death had seen better times

Now, here she is standing over her long time husband. He was asleep, though this doesn't actually mean anything considering how many nights she had tried to wake him. It just meant the woman didn't have to listen to him moan about what he did while he slept, which made up half their arguments anyway ""Do you love me now?"" she screamed at him the moment he stirred. He looked up from his slumber confused ""How can you possibly know that? What are you getting at? We haven't talked properly in months..."" 

She wasn't listening to him anymore. Not that he really expected her to, after everything he told her. All those tears that he could never cry, she heard them clearly. He remembered every joke he ever had on her, only she laughed harder each time ""I was crying! Oh god!"" The whole thing went downhill so fast that nobody else noticed except for Death who rolled her eyes. He couldn't hold back any longer ""You don't fucking believe me?! When have we been happy lately?"" She finally gave in this time, wiping some nonexistent sweat off of her face and replying with anger ""Don't act like it's nothing! You never tell the truth anyway!"" Tears fell down her cheeks that she quickly wiped away, no matter her physical shape her beauty still existed; when life got tough she hid the worst of herself behind the pretty girl, it seemed natural to her, he didn't mind.

","*They think their friends deserve it, but I'd rather just kill them all.*

When my squad first got assigned this mission on Omicron Persei 8, we assumed it would be a simple enough job: take out three known alien worlds that have been causing trouble for humans by infiltrating them with drones that replicate human emotion and drive them over the edge before wiping out their entire society without leaving any trace behind. Simple enough; except for one small detail: everyone had the same thought: ""This is our favorite world."" It was then that things went from bad to worse. They were friendly aliens, which caused serious complications as they hadn't developed into an advanced civilization yet. Our first two attempts at destroying them ended up being incredibly complicated as most people here didn't believe us when we said they weren't worth killing and some refused to believe it either way. The last attempt saw us using our weapons to destroy their planet entirely, yet everything turned upside down later on with our new home planets disappearing from galactic maps. *Where are they?*  And what does that mean for us...? Or maybe why did they end up like this...?
*I told you I wanted more time to talk... no please don't tell me you want another round? How about we skip to the good stuff and go straight to part two. That will be twice your daily dose of this kind of goodness! Make sure to subscribe so we don't miss anything else!*

""So,"" Said Aloysius with his usual cheerful voice. ""After we captured the first planet, they started acting awfully strange and made fun of us while laughing in our faces. Next they moved onto another planet. This one where I guess they decided to create a show where they try to escape death or something. One of those space adventures with a happy ending every episode. Those were rough ones, honestly. No telling how many times their little blue ships flew away before crashing back to earth... And let's not forget about the other one with their robots. They were pretty strong, and those spaceships wouldn't do shit against them until a couple guys managed to fly right through both sides of each robot in half an hour flat without breaking a sweat. If there really were such a thing as heroes among these idiots, I'd say those two should be remembered forever as the bravest members of our armed forces. But no - nobody ever heard of them. I suppose if they died too young, the news got killed by their own parents long ago though..."" We laughed at his words and continued chatting about random dumb crap while sipping tea and eating donuts. As much as I enjoyed hearing him rant in a calm tone, now came the real boring parts again. There are only so many times you can talk about how you accidentally swallowed acid and nearly fried a drone with your teeth before someone breaks the ice. Even worse was Aloysius always making a snarky comment even though he knows nothing about acid or drones and basically just pretends he did because of our mutual shared insanity. So far he'd never actually experienced anything scary enough to give him an opinion on a subject like that. He once fell out of a tree as he was going over his notes with a pencil to avoid having his head blown off by a squirrel. Luckily, nothing happened afterwards. At least nobody noticed that weird orange mark above his nose afterwards... When Aloysius finally gave up and admitted he had nothing else to complain about we swapped places since the sun was setting. My eyes started to hurt already after sitting inside the office for hours so I switched seats with Aloysius, hoping to see more action. But as soon as I relaxed my body on the grass outside he began talking and rambling on about something completely unrelated. Apparently, there was a rumour spread amongst the kids about a special girl who lives on planet Eridanos VIII and she supposedly has amazing hair and green skin. Apparently its colour keeps changing depending on what mood she is feeling. Some idiot tried asking her about it and somehow offended her with his ignorance, saying that nobody really cares about how others feel. In retaliation she slapped him across the face and proceeded to cut his left arm clean off with a dagger. Apparently cutting off someone’s arm leaves scars, resulting in permanent facial disfigurement. She then beat up a nearby guard and took his sword and ran back towards the rest of her gang yelling insults at the retreating guards while they struggled to maintain control of the situation. And so it goes. Just like old days. People aren’t that interesting anymore. Now this guy must have fallen in love with her and decided to make it known all over the place. He claimed that he followed the girl around and learned all about her life, eventually building a romantic relationship with her. Only to find out after a year of dating that she was mentally unstable. And this guy gets heartbroken as hell, refusing to acknowledge the fact that she might just be lying to gain attention. After spending seven years on board another planet he escaped together with his newly acquired wife. He lived happily ever after as a prince, gaining wealth & power along with a kingdom as well. And now, according to him, they live together, waiting for their heir to join Earth's Galactic Empire... Oh man this guy has stories. Sometimes I wonder why he bothered coming here all by himself, especially since no other visitors have arrived within the past month. It seems like nobody wants to visit us anymore. Sure, most of them are probably terrified by how messed up things are back on Alpha Centauri VI but I doubt anyone misses the damn food stalls. Besides, nobody seemed particularly interested in joining the war or learning how hard it is to work within an intergalactic council. Still, whenever he does arrive I wish for him to come faster. His presence brings cheer and reminds me of a golden age filled with joy, laughter and hope. You know, before we discovered that the Universe isn't actually friendly and doesn't care about us. Maybe there wasn't a choice at all. Who knew there were people more messed up than us...
*Wait wait wait* Says Aloysius holding up a hand. *Don’t stop reading! I don’t have another chapter planned yet, but I have a ton of ideas for these. Plus the more views this has the better my life becomes. You guys have done fantastically in my life so far, seriously - thank you*.

","The first human I encountered was named Aila and she looked just as she did on my screen: beautiful. Her brown, straight hair made its way down her back, framing a face with large doe-like eyes that glittered with intelligence and compassion. She had soft white skin under dark circles under them, she sat cross legged on a rock in some abandoned ruins of an alien city and held a telescope to her eye, watching stars drift by for what seemed like hours. 

She said something about space. Something similar to ""what if we found aliens"" or some nonsense like that. No matter how many times I told her aliens have not been discovered yet, that's pretty much impossible given the amount of space out there, it didn't seem to faze her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy repeating it over and over again. When I eventually took a look at her physical body though I realized why; she was incredibly strong and built more like a bear than any human should be. And when Aila smiled she would let slip something that sounded quite familiar coming from my lips, but I couldn't quite place where I'd heard it before.


But even stronger was her personality. She had no malice nor cruelty toward me, nor did she express disgust at my small size. Despite all this she still called me ""my little one"" which offended me quite quickly and I told her so. She laughed and assured me that no harm would come to me, that I should call her ""sister."" Then came the true surprise...she actually enjoyed hugging me as well. Which is the reason I now sit here beside my new girlfriend in a room overlooking space trying to make sense of everything.

It took me awhile to adjust after finding out that we had been the only life form who developed unconditional love throughout the galaxy. I mean it was amazing! After centuries of living with one person your whole life as your romantic partner, why the hell not? The rest of these species would argue back though: if they were being given up over for another because of some trivial difference in their culture. 

I guess things went on too long when I found myself at my deathbed, surrounded by people I thought I could always count on.

I wasn't upset but I knew I wouldn't have died like this if this planet was home.

The TV switched over from pictures of humans to recorded messages they sent on tapes throughout their history. All talking about how much they loved someone else; a husband loving his wife, a sister loving her brother, friends saying goodbye before fighting, etc. The images of them doing those things were blurred out since it was difficult to discern how genuine they were after thousands of centuries. No matter what anyone tried telling me it seemed impossible for someone to truly love another person like us aliens did...



We continued until the tape ended. It switched back over to the video of Earth being struck by asteroids, followed by its death and ultimate destruction by natural solar flares. Then it switched to the same scene again, but this time there was no picture of Earth, instead a bright white sphere appeared in the middle of the television show, which emitted the sound of a beating heart.




We spent most of the trip talking to each other like that. I showed her all of humanity's accomplishments, and she showed me hers. We played games together. We laughed, argued, cried, sang songs, danced, told jokes - we shared countless memories so vivid it would appear as if time itself had been compressed down into these few hours.

In unison they hugged together until finally all bodies slackened, arms gave out and they slumped over onto the grass where the bugs were already biting away happily.

For as long as I had kept up hope that I too would someday find love and build family one day I held onto life. Yet today my love finally died and those who watched from afar simply gave solace in the knowledge that I won't suffer anymore. So yes, some of us are lucky enough to go to that place called Heaven whilst others are forced to keep wandering, and searching endlessly for a kind heart to accept you, but none will ever know this truth unless they die as well, and none may return. Some will say ""you couldn't be happy without company"", to which I reply--no matter how much time has passed since we last did things together you always remember when you were young. What good is companionship if you don't have anyone whom you feel loved by? The point is--those alone ones are the happiest of all because they never grow old and thus never become lonely in death.

","There's a very light thump coming from the other side of that door. As you put up the tape-seal to inspect what was on the inside, you hear her call out ""You think you can beat this guy? I don't know how but I will be back.""

She had been shot in one leg and couldn't walk so she used the body as leverage when opening the door. She opened it with ease and took her pistol. 

It took everything you have not to rush at her or tackle her into the dirt but now wasn't the time to hesitate. The heavy wooden door slammed against the thin metal panel as the force drove an edge through the wood, causing her to cower for cover behind the desk behind the front room office.  But before your eyes could settle on where she might go next, she fired first. You heard the crackle of hot lead as several shots went off and she tripped over a half filled coffee pot.

With the bullet hitting the desk beside the desk chair, a sharp click resonated as the chamber cleared leaving no rounds in it. She stood up slowly, blood spurting from where bullet holes riddled the flesh around both arms and leg.

She pulled out a bottle of vodka from underneath the desk and took a small swig. With blood soaking her jacket, trousers and shirt, she took another sip and continued towards you. She sat down behind the desk and started talking. Her voice raspy and broken, you listened carefully. She told you all about her encounter with the man who hired her. It seems he had come knocking on the doors of his own house expecting some sort of revenge after all this talk between friends online. However, they seemed like a bunch of kids playing dress up compared to him and he had come prepared. He'd shot each member until there were only three left alive after which he'd called for backup before ambushing them and setting the place ablaze as you described it in your testimony. As they struggled to get out, they all died save for her thanks to the smoke inhalation poisoning her comrades more than it did her.

Her voice grew quieter as you realized that this was getting too personal. You took a step back ready to leave, and she looked directly at you. Without warning, she grabbed a bottle cap from her pocket and threw it across the room with deadly intent. You ducked under it, surprised that she aimed with such speed but you were right. There was nothing else to do now but run, and fast, because once she saw you wouldn't move you would face her wrath by whatever means necessary.

","It was never a question of if you'd see him again, only where you'd meet for the last time.

He clutched his leg as he fell, letting out a small wail in pain. His face had gone pale by the time I'd reached him, almost white. As I knelt beside him, a wave of nausea hit me - not from seeing my friend blood spill onto the ground but because of the sudden image that struck my mind; us burying this man into the desert sands together after he refused to join our side on day one. You could not blame him; there were still more survivors left than us yet, and many of those would be far happier without him or any of us. Still, knowing what happened the moment we all got here...I wondered if I would regret this decision one day...though I doubt I'll ever get over the guilt.

He gave one weak smile at me, as I grabbed his hand. ""Hey kiddo, thanks..."" He said with rasping voice. ""...you're welcome."" I replied back solemnly. We hadn't talked much since we first met in camp, but even then it didn't take long before we grew comfortable talking about anything and everything. Now he was speaking his final words in life. The memories kept flooding my head, each one making me wince. Most things went down well between us both. Except for something we couldn't really change now... 

His blood stained my black tactical boots red, reflecting back at him once while he gripped tightly to my arm for support. He slowly closed his eye in resignation, letting loose a shaky breath as I sat next to him. He looked up for a split second and smiled, looking deep in my eyes before he let himself succumb to death...as the sun set behind me and burned away his remaining light. It would probably be another year til any human found that dead body, too. So I buried him right there. In my own dirt. Where it wouldn't be washed away, eaten by ants like most bodies are these days. And just like how he always did to me during bootcamp, I patted him one last time in an attempt to console myself. Then walked off towards the sunset...to go bury more.

","I woke up last night and couldn't fall back asleep again when he had been joking about being in my coffin. I got out of bed, grabbed some water from the fridge and went into the living room where we were supposed to be watching tv for a while before falling asleep. When I looked over I noticed his friends all gathered around him. They seemed distressed but calm at least as they kept speaking amongst each other quietly yet excitedly. I stood still and watched as everyone slowly began to clap, yelling with emotion and laughter. As much as I don't like their behavior sometimes... They always seem so happy together that it annoys me even more so why am i annoyed by this?

I guess seeing how happy they are made me realize one thing after another: He didn't die - he was playing dead. He's actually here. And he can clearly tell I know because I'm just staring at him, wide eyed, dumbstruck, speechless. It turns out he really did play dead which really does seem plausible given he's the same guy who constantly tells jokes and stories involving someone either dying or going to hell. 

""Hey guys."" He smiles gently looking around, then glances at you ""How many have known?"" he asks. Nobody knew and not many people guessed in time so that's an easy answer. I smile at him though, and wave my hand. ""Well, none of them guessed,"" I laugh nervously ""Maybe half if we count how long you actually stayed in there..."" Everyone joins in on laughing as I chuckle awkwardly before turning back to stare out the window waiting for something to happen.

""I don't know if I want you guys to kill me, or not! Come on! Take a break!"" The large axe-wielding man stammers, blood gushing out every second he speaks

The crowd holds their fire swords at him as he says this, but in shock. All that swordmanship they have learned over the past 30 years is useless. No one has seen this kind of magic before, and some haven't even considered magic at all

The leader of the crowd steps forward, lowering his iron greatsword slightly ""My word... Are we really about to give up here?"" He asks, ""For someone who claims to be able to save our lives, you lack any common sense"" He looks down at the wounded man's trembling hands, muttering something unintelligible while simultaneously swinging his greatsword wildly toward the giant axe that sticks out of the man's chest, only stopping when he realizes no one else seems to care at all

The audience goes quiet for the first time tonight, looking more than surprised as more light emanates from his hand. He lets his sword fall and takes another step forward while staring down at the axe, now surrounded by a ring of glowing white sparks and flames

""Don't sell."" ""No matter the circumstance. No matter how desperate it becomes..."" The boss said, giving me that look in his eyes that said: ""My kid doesn't even get this memo,"" but all I could think about was how he got promoted faster than ever before, and made enough money in his first year that he had invested well into another business venture from when he sold his own father's house back in high school.

So here I am now, the 50th new CEO since the original founder died. I'd seen my fair share; some good, some bad. Most were great at keeping up with customer service or producing product for sale, no matter what the market did. But nobody would stay long. A single missed quarter or an incorrect report would be it, and by week two their little startup would be gone. Even our old co-founder left over an issue involving 'a stock options cliff'. Donkeys can't hold money indefinitely. It seemed inevitable that we were going to fail too. At any moment.

I should have known right then and there that I couldn't break his words. That if he had to say that to the newest hire in a billion dollar industry he knew better. They hadn't *told* him though. This guy had come in under cover as my CFO, so far he'd done nothing out of place... until now. All of these guys seem to come off that way but nobody questions it for long. What are they gonna do? Kill me in front of the whole team? Probably not. More like fire me. But wouldn't it be funny if someone actually did end up getting killed? Maybe a nice head shot across their desk where the note reads ""you tried selling the company?"" Wouldn't that make life a helluva lot more exciting.  


Of course now that idea crossed my mind again I immediately thought to myself that maybe I shouldn't go through with doing things like that in the future (because who knows whether or not I'll turn around on that). Instead of killing him I'll simply ask to speak with the next person in line. The third employee hired at the same time as him. She's sitting down here behind the office kitchen table taking notes. And she has been talking really quietly.  And suddenly I realized why. She can type.

[removed]","When you were in college I'd told my friends about the strange dreams that were happening to me. Every night was something different, ranging from being kidnapped by extraterrestrials, to surviving some sort of nuclear apocalypse, or even just walking into school with no clothes on and everyone staring in shock. All while it was happening, nobody believed me.

""I don't believe them"". ""They must have made up all those stories just for laughs"". ""Well why are your clothes still wrinkled?"". These were all things people said, not knowing anything other than the fact that sometimes when I get home from work, I wake up at work, but I wake up in bed this time. At the start, it seemed random. When it finally started repeating itself though, people began to think otherwise. 

Now, after years of waking up at the same place every day only to realise that I hadn't dreamt half as much anymore, I can only imagine that the dream may never have been real. But now, standing outside of the building where my company is located is another matter entirely. My name is Michael Miller, executive director of sales here since September, and I am convinced that I will die tonight. For whatever reason, whenever I'm getting ready for a meeting in the mornings, a little bit before starting my shift at 7am sharp, I suddenly remember that there isn't a car sitting there, so I go check to see if my car is parked somewhere else. The moment I look down at my phone, it rings at 6:58, letting me know that someone will be picking me up. If I call anyone back, I will be late, and then there will be trouble. It's impossible to make it downstairs without waking up first, and I can usually hear everything else going on around me whilst sleeping, so it feels more realistic this way - although I can't figure out why these things keep making me miss the bus in a perfectly normal day. Today doesn't feel any different, but I should probably grab my keys. There's nothing more depressing than having to wear an outfit when its raining because you forgot to buy a spare pair of shoes.

[removed]","For the first few weeks of my internship at Nasa, I felt truly grateful. There were days when even the thought of leaving work got me excited because working for Nasa brought me closer and closer to getting back home to my family. Then came Christmas. My little sister has been struggling quite a bit lately, and I really wanted her to have something nice this year, so I took the initiative as soon as possible and picked up some presents last minute. In response to the surprise gift ideas I gave to her over Christmas break, she told me that Nasa was no longer going forward with paying for her college tuition. Her scholarship money had dried up, but more importantly, their policy on tuition reimbursement didn't include ""family members"", even if those members are your parents, brothers or sisters, cousins or children.

In total shock, I asked my mother if her reasoning was valid. She looked at me and said nothing. So we went through our options until my Dad said he would try to get another job (to which neither of us saw coming) and all seemed well again. This lasted until my father passed away shortly after my sister started working in June 2015, and now I see why Nasa wasn't able to pay for my sister's schooling. When did they change their policies...? And from whom should I be asking questions regarding her tuition benefits? If anyone knew how to get past the Nasa bureaucracy, it would surely be someone within the organization...and everyone is afraid to talk.

In a few years it's not going to be ""I'm gonna start a war"", it'll just be ""fuckin start a war.""

There was nothing else they could do at this point, their colonies had grown too strong and so had the power struggles that led up to it. The entire galaxy knew there would come a day when one of these parties will just pull the trigger; it happens all the time. Everyone expected it though, or if they didn't everyone found something to justify why they shouldn't actually care about it anymore.

No one had really done anything worthwhile since the galaxy wars began but most felt the least they could do is be prepared for whatever conflict comes next, some sort of proxy war against each other. Even the little bastards like me who couldn't even carry an axe on my own without getting in trouble tried to get as close to the actual fighting as possible.

And then TronaldDump decided to show off his new powers, I don't know what he did exactly, you see I got shot at the moment shit started burning I lost track. All I can tell you is that I made sure that all of them died. Every single motherfucker on board that stupid spaceship had to pay the ultimate price, no exceptions. I only left after everything was over because one guy asked me to shoot him for killing his friends, maybe it was the bloodlust talking and maybe it was pure fear for his future but I gave him a clean death with my plasma rifle.

Everyone's been celebrating ever since, except myself. Sure, I still have every body count, nobody wants to talk to me. My family thinks I killed more people than necessary by taking out those fuckers before any others died including the ones on his ship but it took less than ten minutes once I arrived to stop the fight. You'd think somebody would want the medal anyway. Hell I might need to kill people myself now in order for us to become allies again.

I don't give two fucks about medals, money or territory or being heroes. So long as there's space where we can run free no one's getting into trouble with me. That's where the real war lies. We just gotta keep making sure we're closer than the other side to the guns of mass destruction in our hands until we make our move. Then everyone will regret messing with us.

The crew all turned toward me as they glanced out of their respective ports, one by one. A few smiled. The others looked back down at their consoles for a moment longer before looking again. As if I had said something unusual or provocative. Which was most likely the case.  ""Hey, it's fine."" I shrugged my shoulders while keeping my eyes out over the sea below where I could hear our customers laughing and making merry with each other. Maybe we were just being quiet today? Well, whatever.

Some people laughed, but many kept smiling. The rest continued to busy themselves; it seemed like they had things to do. One passenger looked straight out the window, so I waved at them. It took three seconds, about half the amount it would take anyone else to turn around and look back. That was an odd thing: he gave a thumbs-up at us, and then a slow blink. The wink that he did right now - probably shouldn't be able to blink at someone that way. Whatever. Let him. He doesn't hurt me; after all. And if he does...?

","The first thing that I remembered was the smell of jet fuel. The taste and texture were quite similar to what came from a car or motorcycle, but there was more chemical tang and something akin to burnt metal accompanying it. As an infant my mother had always told me that whenever the smell of jet fuel arose, she knew we would soon begin our journey out of this tiny, red-roofed city on the outskirts of a bustling metropolis. And now was my father doing that same action again when he said ""Ready to land?""

I don't know how I did it, but as the crew called for everyone to secure their seatbelts, I somehow ended up in the cockpit. Of course I didn't realise until we began to climb at which point I noticed the large panel containing various buttons and dials. The autopilot control panel sat directly beside the co-pilot seat so I quickly found it, but everything looked confusingly futuristic to me. A couple of quick taps led me to press start. As soon as we climbed above cloud cover my nose started twisting towards the front half of the aircraft; only a slight movement to counter it, however, because the whole plane seemed to rotate around an unseen axis. My hand wandered further down, then stopped on the throttles: two black knobs labelled with white text read - ""LOW"" and ""HIGH"". Turning the low knob, I could barely feel it turn. A gentle whine emanated from within the engine, though as the power grew, so too did its frequency; eventually the little noise became very high pitched squeals like a pig trapped in a blender.

As I turned the lever past LOW and adjusted the thrusters, it seems my co-pilot, who appeared rather anxious by the pale flush of his cheeks and clammy sweats staining his arms, decided to take over and guide us back to earth. He pointed at the screen next to him displaying a chart with several lines going off into the sea. We flew close enough to see a few miles below us with clearly defined coastlines. It seemed to be raining hard on board too as I felt some moisture splashing upon my brow. Luckily all the passengers seemed just as confused as I was and were trying in vain to calm themselves. Then I remembered what happened a few months ago; a few weeks before Christmas when I had taken my grandmother out to lunch. My grandfather told me about how even after they retired in 1964 he used to visit his sister in New York every Christmas. That Christmas he had gone on his flight back home from Europe and saw nothing like this...

This was not an accident, this wasn't even some other form of life. It was my fault, all because of what I had done.

""Ok! You can put the gun away now. Please do not point it at anyone!"" joked the Italian President as he stepped in. He held up an apple that had been passed around the room and shot out of nowhere in rapid succession as people cried 'Ah ah ah!' and chuckled at his joke. They all grabbed the apples, took a bite, threw them into the fire pit they were surrounding and lit them each on their own, and walked outside while the flames burned away everything of what once seemed like nothing. All except for the American President who watched the other leaders leave before shooting himself in the forehead.

","""Ready?"" Said Russia, as he pulled out his gun.

Each nation in attendance nodded in confirmation. It was an odd gathering: all the countries of Earth. Every single superpower, big and small - North Korea, South Africa, France, England, Italy, etc., were seated around a table, waiting to see who lived or died... and ruled the world after that.

Their leader handed them each a bullet, then gave them two minutes to decide how they wanted to be treated before their death (the first person with suicidal tendencies to do so would be exiled, along with those from countries whose leaders refused to put them down). Then he lit up the match he brought.  

Russia closed his eyes and held it up until it began glowing. After five seconds, the entire room went black out except for him. 

When it came back on, only six members of the crowd had a candle left to hold. Some had shot themselves, others had tried to kick off a civil war between different countries. One started crying as soon as Russia walked by him. As most people looked at him, Russia stood up. He motioned everyone into formation while shouting: ""Alright! We have now gone through hell and back, and we are all still alive. In order to settle who will rule the earth, let's play a game.""

He proceeded to explain how everyone would be divided into three teams. At random, Russia selected Team A: United States, Canada, Japan. The second group consisted of China, Germany, Sweden. Finally, Russia threw in team C with Russia itself, Belarus, and Syria.

And, of course, since it was a game to kill anyone outside of the winners, Team D consisting of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Norway kicked off playing against America, leaving behind only 30% chance of survival.  Team E made up of Israel, Romania, Argentina, South Africa kicked off against the remaining team member and continued to fight.  At this point only two nations were left alive, but it turned out those two were both part of the same political party; the Americans won because there was no difference between what both parties agreed upon.   

With the loss of two continents, there were now twelve other nations left, and many more individual representatives from all walks of life such as priests, scientists, military figures and CEOs, and even artists were elected and given control over their respective nations and territories. When these individuals took over their own countries, everyone else was taken hostage to work on behalf of some kind of government or political movement.  Many ended up dead eventually, or got their job completed and died peacefully in their sleep. But not all were so fortunate. There were several instances where dictators, tyrannical leaders, etc. rose up during their time and put down protests, rebellions, and attacks on whomever dared oppose them. However, whenever it seemed like someone was about to win, a new nation would choose its leadership randomly, thus breaking any kind of power structure for the next round. They remained undeterred and fought again for their lives and control of the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, the ten nations that could not make decisions quickly enough remained scattered around a nearby table, picking from a bag to pick their next opponent and winning the tournament either way.  Every hour, one representative from that day's chosen nation arrived at the location and joined up to challenge one other representative of whatever country picked before. The longest the tournament lasted were twenty rounds. Even that long though, many had already died and several leaders had surrendered without fighting, simply too scared to actually lose forever.  Eventually, only two players were left: One representing the former USSR, the other representing Europe.    As the games went on, however, it became evident that Europe and the USSR had fallen apart completely; most of the Eastern half having switched sides with the USA, much of Western Europe with the Americas and lastly many parts of Central and Southern Asia going to form independent states in defiance of China's authority. No matter, the final matches had become close, the players barely able to keep a level head, yet no one had been shot yet despite having one person in their sights across the table.     

So far, nobody had died yet.

","Russia had a little secret weapon in World War 3 – it wasn’t nuclear, or chemical, or any thing you could see. It was the ability to create illusions so realistic they were nearly indistinguishable from reality.

“You want me to make that happen,” asked Putin, looking over his shoulder at another soldier dressed similarly, “and I will.” As if on cue, the two soldiers walked out into the hallway. One after the other, each of the six nations around Russia waited patiently as their leaders slowly filled up the room with more bodies. As each nation entered Russia made sure not to let its new enemy know who he is or where he is sitting until an agreement has been reached - this way everyone else will trust him. They all do, Russia is already holding them. After a while the body count grows and grew higher than anyone expected. Just when it looked like there wouldn’t be enough victims, five heads popped up over the middle of the table, and within a few minutes there were a total of nine men sitting on each side of the table. Each man was smiling as if nothing had happened - as if there was plenty left to be done, which should have made their eyes wide with fear but they had resigned themselves to their fates.

Finally Putin stood up and began speaking. He did not raise his voice, the words coming out slowly, clearly - he always spoke deliberately. He didn’t say a word about what he would ask for, just kept repeating the phrase ‘you are safe now’. Everyone knew what meant in practice, they saw how calm and composed they both stayed even while guns were pointed at their respective necks and no one had dared move a finger. There was no reason to think they weren’t all happy with the situation. Or at least most of them. There had always been a number of those Russians that didn’t mind a bit of bloodshed, who liked to watch innocent people die as long as they themselves were spared. Their lack of remorse only strengthened Russias position as the worlds police - it kept its power unchallenged until quite recently...

","There is a large oak tree in the middle of my living room. Not really a tree, more like an enormous root system growing above ground and reaching out toward anyone who comes near it as if trying to pull them back into the earth. When I was 5 years old i saw an old man pass by under its canopy and felt compelled to show him my favorite painting. He stopped where the roots were closest to the pavement and asked me what the picture was about. In response I told him that it was a garden that grew outside the trunk which became quite interesting so they built a house upon it after having grown tired of climbing up towards the sky. He shook his head at the end of my sentence and said ""oh god you little shits"" before getting hit by the tree itself and dragging him through the floor of his home along with the remainder of his body through the wall to the basement below. From then on, whenever i looked at the largest trees i thought of him.


For over half a decade now, there have been numerous visitors attempting to enter this giant's territory while many others seek sanctuary beneath it, including myself. All have come and gone over these last few months, yet tonight one of them has arrived and something inside me snapped.

I haven't decided what will happen next though. Will i invite them in or push them off? Shall i stand idly and watch as the cycle restarts again or call the cops? Who knows! It can go any number of ways: someone might find comfort within the tree's embrace while some may try to tear away at its branches to reach deeper down into hell, or perhaps something worse.

Regardless, this is not what i expected.  It will be a night i won't forget.

","I am not the same as some, some who have no memories, or any semblance of time remaining and then they just vanish in an instant with a light blue haze emanating around them. I, on the other hand I hold no recollection of my past, nor any notion of a future. Though that is not important today.

All I can remember was this:

The first thing I noticed when I woke up was how calm everything was. The only sound was that of the crickets singing and a gentle wind passing through the tall grass. My eyes opened slowly and looked over at the soft brown dirt that had become familiar to me after years of digging holes while working in these exact locations. For some reason, this was where I always felt safe despite the fact that there was always something waiting just past death’s door, beyond the long white fences separating me from eternal torment.

A lone yellow dandelion sat right next to my bed and it seemed quite out of place. Then, the wind swirled faster, blowing away the dandelion leaves, and before I could even blink what I realized hit me. It was not a dark abyss I saw. There was nothing. Nothing at all except the occasional shadow of trees swaying behind my eyelids as the light began dimming fast. That is when the voices began... not screams, no this was much calmer. I heard laughter ring through my mind, so real they sounded like actual words being spoken to me. 

""You look so good,"" one said gently, ""finally awake."" Other voices were quieter, barely audible as thoughts running through my head. These were more like the sounds made by a child playing quietly, happy. Finally, and almost too sweet sounding ""He's so handsome isn't he?"" another voice chimed in. A little boy was giggling and I couldn't help but smile warmly at him. Was he telling his mother about me?

I soon realized I wasn't alone though. A man stood behind the young boy, slightly taller, older yet somehow still thin. He bent down and whispered in to the childrens ear, ""Did she know?"" I did not answer, as if scared that doing so would wake him. As expected though he gave up trying. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an object that resembled a small black book with red letters engraved into its front. And without warning slammed it on top of the pile of leaves covering my face. I instinctively leaped back, but stopped short before taking a step away from the book. His laughter returned in full force as he continued writing in the diary in his hand and started reading aloud. Every sentence ended in confusion and disgust toward me. I tried reading too but I wasn't fast enough and quickly gave up. If I recalled correctly, I think the last phrase was ""what a disgusting monster!"" It took my breath away to hear such foul things. I mean, it may be true but damn! That guy needs to go pick on someone his own size.

","It wasn’t the roses, or even the exotic bird feeders and the numerous seating areas. It wasn’t even the fact it was so quiet; even in a town where everything is always shut down around 4:30 pm people still like their neighbors, and would always hang out at night until just past five. No, no thing could have caused me to turn away my front door and simply walk into my garden - nothing but the soft brown light bathing all who enter as golden dust.

He did nothing unusual besides his bare feet stepping lightly on grass with every step he took towards me. No one has ever walked onto my grounds without looking back or saying hello since I bought it, though I’m sure quite a few came before I saw the golden dust rise upon their footsteps. Yet somehow... *this* fellow managed to stay long enough to see me look toward him; not once, not twice, but three times in quick succession. Each time he returned his gaze. I had no idea what compelled me, but I knew it had something to do with a warm feeling growing inside of me. When I met his eyes we locked and there were no longer any words needed. He smiled. A smile as bright as the sun that shined in those trees and as friendly as the bees and butterflies that gathered flowers in abundance by the thousands. His hand went up and he said “Howdy.”

I don’t know why I answered “Hee-hee” if it felt more like an actual greeting, yet the two exchanged grins and laughter flew between us as they stood side-by-side. From what I can tell we spent a lot of time laughing together, the conversation flowed naturally from a joke here, and then another there as quickly as each sentence left our lips. I didn’t realise how bored I was; the silence after the moment that gave birth to our friendship. We talked about things that seemed trivial at first, but grew deeper each time we spoke. Our talks drifted from funny stories to memories of childhoods to favorite places we’ve been and countries we wished we’d visited. With much delight I learned all of his tales, he in turn asked many questions about mine. My answer to which would later shock him when he found that some truths couldn’t be told. The rest of the evening was filled with these kind exchanges; the sun began to set behind him, but I hardly noticed as he continued talking. As time passed, with no intention of ending our session soon, I called him “Jeff”, just as it seems to everyone else. Jeff stayed by my side while twilight turned to complete darkness. The last remnants of sunlight left the sky as we discussed such things as death itself. This talk lasted as long as anyone in the neighbourhood thought fit, as most folks have little sense of reason regarding death, particularly when the person talking lives 98 years old and enjoys the peace of dusk instead of bustling crowds. In short, our meeting would go on far longer because of lack of respect from others around us. Just when we reached a final conclusion that neither of us wanted to hear anymore.  An empty bottle of water fell from the porch steps right outside the garden gates and Jeff stopped what he was doing, a flicker of annoyance apparent in his normally unreadable features. He looked behind me only briefly, but there before him lay a young boy crying beside the door.

His reaction was instant. A sigh escaped his lips as he grabbed the tears threatening to spill from his baby face and rubbed them away. When he returned my gaze again he whispered softly “Sorry.” Then hurried over to the child and hugged him close. If I hadn't heard him I wouldn't have, but I did, and so I held the tears in from wanting to scold him. But no! Not him. Rather, myself. Who am I? Why bother now? I realised the sadness, and shame, coursing through me well past the point of embarrassment. That was not an innocent cry. Not the tearful sobs of childhood grief or heartbreak. Those occur in homes. Those occur within families. These are parents crying as they carry their children in their arms during early morning wakings, babies whose minds haven’t even begun to solidify themselves, infants who cannot distinguish between day and night; none of these were present. It was the cold calloused wails of someone screaming for whatever they may not understand. There was a man standing near the path to my house. A thin air filled the room as blood spread across his pallid skin, leaving an ominous crimson behind. More than ten years ago I swore to myself that I would never again let this happen to anyone, especially not anyone precious. All too well remembered is the sight of my ex-husband beating our son, the pain and terror he must have gone through to ensure it happened to me rather than him. And so I rushed down there, calling out to him over and over again before falling unconscious under his heavy hands and losing consciousness entirely. Now, decades later I was determined to avoid a similar fate. He died shortly after, his heart giving out just as my son grew taller than he ever was in life. Still unable to bear a man killing his own flesh and blood, despite being dead for almost a decade - I sobbed along with the grieving family, and promised revenge to the one responsible. I will continue to mourn alongside those dear to me, but now I want to take vengeance. One shot against the evil one that committed crimes like this is all I need. All I need is this, and if this does what his deeds require me to do it shall fulfill its purpose. I made sure he could hear me, and cried again for perhaps a quarter to half hour. Finally collapsing back into myself after coming to terms with my emotions. At last we resumed our conversation and sat back, having enjoyed each others company for hours. Both of us holding different thoughts and beliefs, both of us happy for different reasons, yet together.

","I don't like it when strangers show up at my gate, not that I ever really say anything back. It is rude after all, and they can have no idea what I am thinking as a human.

But it feels different with her now. Her skin glows, her eyes are closed in prayer, hands clutched around the fabric of her dress tightly. She is clearly one of them, and she shouldn't be here. But something is holding her back; I notice her eyes are open, and watching me intently.

""Why?"" she asks softly as if addressing a question only she and I could hear. 

The silence that follows isn't awkward because we both know the answer. All the reasons why no stranger should ever find our garden, just become less relevant each day. 

She leaves as quickly as she appears, without offering words of thanks or apology, as is her right, since there are none given. The silence rings out, not awkward anymore than before, and I sigh as it fills the space I leave behind: ""You came here to get killed...but where else would you go?"".



A moment later, her form slowly fades into thin air, leaving only a faint glow behind, an echoing ""Thank you"" bouncing off of my own lips, the reason now being obvious. And perhaps even more than before, I do not welcome visitors; unless, of course, the visitor wants to thank us.

","The little creature stopped and looked at me sideways, its round head cocked and staring intently before suddenly scrambling up an oak tree branch and leaping into the air before launching itself onto the canopy with ease. It was followed by several other squirrels doing the same. As the rodents disappeared over the tops of the branches I felt as if something had been lifted from my back.

A pair of large brown eyes darted through the trees with curious interest. With one bound another rodent launched into the air from underneath a log nearby. Two rabbits scurried out of cover and took off on their own. The rabbit in front led the way then two more joined the chase, which seemed unusual, but also oddly normal amongst these woodland denizens.

All manner of animals began to run alongside them - foxes, chipmunks, deer. Birds fluttered down and took to the sky overhead, weaving between the trees like a flurry of brown feathers, occasionally stopping to take flight again, while insects and reptiles made for surprising companions along this race toward some unknown destination. A wolf howled in support from its perch above the pack and many did not show surprise but rather encouragement, joining the animal frenzy with each passing minute.
 
What started as one small group now spread across most of the park behind the trees we were running away from. There were no rules or set pace, just pure instinct, raw primal desire, and the pursuit of prey towards the final flag planted upon a hilltop beyond our sight.  Something was motivating us - even though none of us could discern what it was. The fact that we were following each other didn't necessarily help things - the feeling of dread became apparent only as the sun began to dip below the horizon casting long shadows from behind us, lengthening the chase.


No one knows why a squirrel decides on such a course of action, nor do they know where it takes you once your foot leaves the edge of the wood, but that doesn't stop us from running.

","Every one knew why I ran here: they could feel my pace and would start from their den, home or wherever and follow me along as I ran to complete my daily routine.

As soon as I broke into the wood line a figure started to run beside me. It was an animal that was quite obvious who it was. The white-tailed deer, which we had named ""Fawn"". The two were nearly identical except for Fawn's tail, of course - being all bushy brown furred behind. And she really didn't know what she was doing half the time! She tripped over everything in our path but always managed to jump back up, never seeming fazed by her clumsiness at all. To this day I still don't understand how she did not break her neck already so many times... 

""Hey, Fawn! Come on!"" I yelled, picking up my pace slightly. 

She kept falling further behind every second. I wonder if I had made enough of a mess to scare her off? That can only happen with someone you have never seen before.

A few more animals popped up alongside us, joining Fawn in the pursuit. My heart suddenly stopped whenever we reached another creature because even though I had no idea what these people were like and I could run past them without much effort I couldn't help wondering if they liked each other - it was awkward. 

Sure enough a giant wolf came bounding after us while holding onto something far too large in size for its body to carry: a baby raccoon. I slowed down instantly as well as the others so he wouldn't be left behind; I mean there was probably some kind of bond going on between them, right? He wasn't alone - he was following four rabbits, jumping through trees and leaping over streams at his feet. Why I couldn't tell - it looked odd somehow, even for him. 

Suddenly another sound echoed deep in the forest, startling me. A moose began to head toward us. There was no room now and I could see where he was heading towards - I should never have come out of the tunnel today. 

I watched in horror as he charged straight towards me! Even though I was terrified for myself I forgot about everybody else until he got close enough. For sure I would die. But then... something strange happened - the rabbit hopped ahead of the group and let out a scream that seemed almost human in nature. This attracted the moose and I felt safe again. 

The creature hesitated for a moment longer before turning away from me and leaving me alone once more. The little rabbits followed suit. If I didn't hurry they would not make it and we were going to have to walk slowly if the fox tried catching us.

...And I hear them screaming, ""Come on, we've been waiting for you..."" 
""Let's go, everyone!"" shouted a nearby fox who was sprinting like crazy. 

I laughed at him as he tripped and lay on his side. It looks like one of the rabbits was taking up his slack by jumping straight ahead with both legs together. In fact there was another rabbit just off his tail!  The animals are not exactly competing friendly since they seem so quick. So is that what I was supposed to think? Did my foot fall asleep and let me think that I was going through such a fast paced race while really it was slow? I looked back again and sure enough it was slowly but surely becoming a close neck-and-neck competition for us to cross that finish line.
I quickly glanced at the rabbit leading which I had gotten too used to seeing and heard a voice say ""Well here comes you idiot, I bet you didn't even have the sense to hold your bladder in."" The rabbit had called out as if the joke wasn't already obvious. I took it into consideration. A turtle could win this after how long it has kept its distance. Of course there was only time for this joke before I began running towards the finish line.

*200 million years ago: “No matter what people might say you are capable of doing, try to do less.”
*300 million years ago: “...and never judge others without forgiving yourself” (The show ends). It seems so easy now. Every time we get down on ourselves it always comes down to this: *We all make mistakes*, right? That makes sense, though who would actually forgive their own wrongdoings if they truly happened? 

As decades went on, humanity grew wiser, stronger, kinder, and more united, although not in the way you think. The teachings of Mr. Rogers would become harder for everyone to accept as some began to realize that certain events really did happen just like he claimed, while others tried to discredit him saying he was crazy and should have been put away. Though it wasn’t until he died at sixty-seven years old that the truth came out… or rather, the deception he lived.

Fred didn’t die; he simply remained in the same house. His original wife died off before he turned 40 because she lost an incurable disease which eventually became her terminal illness. As years passed by she fell ill again—but this time, her doctor said it would be okay. She would live another two hundred years! Then, ten days after the announcement, the news arrived again; this time the cancer returned but worse than before. By then, he knew what to expect and gave into temptation and cheated death—again. So there he remained forevermore, giving thousands upon thousands of hours worth of advice during this period and becoming infamous in history.

But one day, his secret became public knowledge because he couldn’t find another human soul willing to take him in despite all this time. Someone decided they wanted to test his sincerity... by killing him.... but instead the person ended up dying when something suddenly snapped inside of Fred….something told him *don’t hurt me anymore*. When the authorities finally got close enough to interview the lone survivor, nobody was ready for what he confessed….

","""When you die,"" says Fred, his voice raspy and full of life as always, ""you become part of something bigger than yourself: The Great Cloud."" 

""What does that mean?"" one child in the audience asks. The elder Fred gently pats their head and shakes his head with a sad smile before sitting next to them.

""That means you will be a part of us, forever watching over others like us until we meet again. This place was started because everyone has children they loved but died young or never got to see them live out their lives. Fred continues, still looking at his hand in front of him while talking about what happened back then when he lost Liz to cancer. It takes me through all my regrets, failures I could not overcome. Everything that made her leave behind an impact unlike any other human on this planet. 

This room's contents were donated by our volunteers to help provide shelter for children who have lost parents. When your hearts are cold and empty, there is some comfort coming from those left behind knowing children don't remember you being dead. Those same children sometimes come back and visit you when no one else would. 

I hope none of you do so to anger me, though. And please, for God sakes, don't come here if you want drugsAndEndTag/weed/whatever makes things better in lieu of dealing with death. That kind of stuff just turns people into monsters instead. 

There's also the people whose only connection left is a dog, a cat or a fish. Well we love every living creature here too! If you feel alone, or maybe just scared, we're all trying our best to keep the light on inside these walls so nobody walks away feeling completely alone in their loneliness. Or even worse...empty. 

It helps knowing someone will be there after you say goodbye; someone with the same name but different skin colour. You may not know where you are right now, but it doesn't matter to God either. If you hear your name called, or get to watch television programmes made about you, you know you aren't going home alone tonight. No more crying boys. No more girl scouts wondering what's wrong. Only the soft voices of angels around you to make everything seem OK. And soon enough, you can go on another big adventure and explore new horizons together. A million times over if necessary, until both of us finally decide to take over space travel and take humans with us. Or stay up here amongst stars. But don't worry...once a friend dies, that won't happen much anymore, at least as far as *we* can tell anyway...""

[removed]","He's been doing it since he was seven years old. In a fit of anger after getting punished for not completing his chores and having his video game taken away, he swore an oath never to get into that mess again. The words ""No Nut 2018"" scrawled in blood across a piece of paper kept him from losing himself under the influence of any drug or alcohol.  

The day came around quick, though no one really noticed. School had ended, summer vacations were over. There was nothing but time until October. His parents finally gave up on his obsession with this odd goal, thinking he would move on eventually, especially when they saw how incredibly hard-headed the kid turned out to be; he wouldn't even let them have cake at their birthday parties if everyone else did. Then, something shifted. A strange aura appeared all around him, a light that didn't quite fall, as if it wanted to be anywhere other than there. The air around him vibrated, a subtle buzzing, followed by crackling noises, before lightning struck near him, only to fade away in mere seconds after it hit. Something felt...different today. He knew it somehow, despite knowing that there was no logic behind what he felt, there could've easily been some sort of electrocution due to lighting. Yet something felt different, as if his brain was being assaulted with bits of knowledge that made no sense whatsoever. The electricity continued its way through his body and everything faded to black. When he finally woke up, it was like someone painted a rainbow across the clouds outside his window. Everything was bright white, while colorful patterns danced around in swirling patterns. The ground looked like another world entirely. Trees sprouted from nowhere, flowers bloomed where rocks once stood. Every sound you could make echoed off the surfaces surrounding him. That's when he heard it: the music. It wasn't human produced; there was no orchestra with instruments. It was simple drums and percussion that seemed like the voice itself was playing. And so he started dancing again; now without any restraint, without inhibition. It felt like flying. Time disappeared and he realized that he couldn't move anymore, he just had to feel the music flow through his body. All things around him stopped suddenly, including the song, leaving him motionless, wondering who cut the music in half. As he reached up, he could see the sky above him clear out to reveal the Earth below him spinning silently, his house looking almost too good to be real. After reaching down to touch the ground beside his feet, he got back to feeling the soft grass between his fingers, he began walking towards the horizon, not realizing where he was heading to. Just follow your heart, he told himself. Soon, mountains and valleys became visible in front of him and every thing lost shape once more. But then again, maybe he didn't exactly lose it, because now he sees them clearly, can't tell which one is higher, looks like he never walked forward at all. Mountains disappear as the sun rises higher in the sky, soon becoming replaced by houses, cars, people running everywhere, lights flickering on and off. Cities are gone in minutes, cities filled with buildings look nothing like the one he lives in except for the roof being on top of each other, and roads appear nowhere. Suddenly, it feels as if time has slowed to a stop yet he was running at the edge of the city, not noticing what was ahead of him. He stops and looks down to realize that his clothes are torn apart, stained with sweat, with dirt on his face and hair. He quickly realizes that his legs seem numb and weak, barely capable of supporting his weight. He falls to his knees and cries for help only to be met by the sound of birds singing right above him. So he continues to run until he gets tired. He lays under a tree, panting heavily, his arms trembling, trying to catch his breath. Finally, sleep comes quickly, he falls asleep and dreams of rainbows. As morning breaks, everything becomes clear; he's still in bed, surrounded by warm blankets, next to pillows holding him up. There is no phone nearby, neither is his laptop, nor television. Only an empty chair sitting in place of his desk. He gets out of bed and stares out the window for hours and days, pondering about what happened. Was it only an illusion? Or was it something supernatural? One night, while going back to bed, he starts crying tears of laughter, imagining how his family will react to him claiming that he isn't insane. He walks down the stairs and enters the kitchen, looking for food to eat. Instead, there is a plate of cookies waiting for him on the table, covered in ice cream with sprinkles. Tears stream down his face but he doesn't care. Another laugh escapes from him. What was so funny about that situation? Wait, did he just hear that word? Cookies! Oh goddammit, not again. ""Why?"" asked the voice before he could finish talking, ""Why would I put ice cream on my cookies?!"" ""Wait..."" whispered Steve nervously, unable to form a coherent sentence, ""...that's not possible!""",2.875,0.400390625,1.1640625

I look back and see the last of my home world behind me looking just like it did when we took off from earth. Oh how those poor people are going to be pissed if they discover that their home has been destroyed. When I arrive on planet two I open my eyes to what looks to be a nice sandy beach with trees in the distance. Now this looks kinda like paradise why would I bother leaving if the best part already happened? Then suddenly one thing occurs to me, why did I bring a gun with me when I left?  Ah yes nevermind

After taking another look at this island (It really wasn't nearly as good as it seemed) I decide to take a swim. As I sink deeper into the water the first question comes to mind ""Where am I?"" In any other circumstances I would have no idea but somehow I knew where I was and all the places I could go... Well there were certainly a lot more than just the ocean surrounding me at least.  As soon as I got out of the water I started to feel sick from hunger. It appears the food here tasted horrible so I decided to hunt instead. At least the creatures here weren't exactly hard to kill with a single hit

""What should I call you?"" A strange voice rings in my head. I quickly try to focus on something else but before I can even think twice about whether to answer him or not there comes up some sort of reply, ""You seem lonely. You know, humans tend to enjoy loneliness."" Ok ok maybe I don't have alot to talk about now. I turn around in the opposite direction to hear the voice but nothing yet comes. Wait a second.... *Where* am I? I didn't go swimming, or hunting until yesterday anyway. Wait a minute... How did I do all of that without my body? There's probably something missing here that makes this whole concept impossible!

Suddenly a strange feeling hits me, right here, right now, so real that I wonder if its a dream or not. My hand goes down to my stomach and i can feel the wet, cold metal against my skin. I don't notice anything different then I realize what happened: my arms are gone?! Not to mention my legs! Where the hell are my arms?! Wait, wait! That feels familiar now...... This isnt mine, but I dont remember where I lost them. Or who took them!

","""You know, I remember that exact day too. 15th October, 2049.""

""Yeah well you're gonna want to listen if you really are listening so pay attention..."" 

The two sat there for five minutes in complete silence until Billy broke up the tension. ""Okay let's just get started then shall we?"" 

Billy looked over at the guy sitting opposite him. The room was dark with only light coming from the man beside him holding a large torch on the ground. He watched as his companion set aside his notebook and pen, leaving them on the shelf behind him. The man took off the cloth covering some wires on the wall. A moment later another cloth went on top of something else before pulling that away, revealing what I assume to be the switch for turning on all four security cameras inside the warehouse. Once done setting all these pieces up his body moved along each wire looking them at once, pausing briefly outside of every camera. The man stopped at the final point where he touched the wires together bringing up the image that would give away the whereabouts of whoever was going to die. He turned back around to look at me before standing back up and picking up his notebooks and pens before placing them back on the shelf.

We both stayed silent this time. Neither of us spoke after the second man put everything together. All eyes were on the computer screen before us. As we waited the only sound in the room was the faint ticking coming from our watches and the occasional hum of electricity flowing through our bodies when we turned our heads slightly to take in whatever new view had been uploaded onto the display. It wasn't very long though, I soon noticed. The whole thing was up within a matter of seconds, taking no longer than it took my brain to register exactly what was showing me on the screen. Two men in full combat uniform had entered through a window into the building via zipline or rope-ladder, and they appeared to have been fighting. One was clearly in pain, however; struggling against their assailant who seemed like they could potentially finish the job. My stomach churned with excitement as I realised exactly how wrong I must be about who it was that got shot. 

I thought to myself, I thought the other man did it. If the one running circles had gotten in first... then by now surely they would've knocked him down. 

But instead he fought back... harder than anyone should fight back from such an ambush. By the looks of things neither would live.

""Right, any questions?""

I swallowed hard before swallowing nervously before making eye contact with the one named ""Billy"". 

He grinned and smirked as if it was obvious what I needed to ask him: *Who killed the gunman?*

","""Here.  This's for you.""

His first reaction was shock, but then again when have I ever been any good at reading faces?  My second thought wasn't how shocked or surprised I was, but rather what kind of weapon this guy had.    A rifle! A big heavy one on his back strapped tight across his chest, clearly not one that I would be able to pull the trigger.  Instead I quickly grabbed my hand-me-down revolver with no ammo.     I shot him as many times as I could through two walls, only to realise they were bullet proof.  As I checked to see if there was any way to take out the man inside of that container in time, I realised that I needed a different approach.   No, I hadn't come here just to gun down an old homeless dude.  He must have bribed someone else here to do the job; I could tell this from how relaxed he seemed.   Taking out one wall of the building wouldn't bring me into position, it probably brought the owner of the warehouse right here behind it.  Well then all you can do is try and use your stealth skills.  That means taking out both walls on either side, hoping whatever happens next ends up giving me a clean shot at the guy.   The best option is also taking away his weapons too so that I don't get taken off guard by him coming around with another shot ringside.

""They're coming."" Said Billy. 

""No, not them. Me. You can run.""

Billy dropped his phone to his lap and sat on one of the broken folding chairs that littered the floor between stacked shipping containers. If I could get this up now...

I shook my head slightly and sighed as the first man strolled over to where I had laid down. ""Damn, did you even read what you were doing?"" Asked a new voice. It took me by surprise since it didn't sound like James had found the last bottle with scotch he was going through in hopes someone would just leave him alone. James walked over to me with care in all he'd done over this last month or two. This whole time he had been walking around here every day hoping we wouldn't find him. All in hopes of the one thing that was keeping him alive; The $300 bill from Billy. Which should be interesting because as soon as they got there, neither James nor I realized just how close Billy really was. Or if we saw anything at all. Either way I managed to catch him sneaking into the main entrance before Billy did.

","""Alright, well. You got your shit together now."" The guy said as he watched the man through his gun sights.

He hadn't had any other orders in years: every job just disappeared. He'd been trying for a decade to live life like normal, save up money, build everything from scratch to ensure that one day he could leave things behind and do something else with the skills he'd learned in the business. It wasn't easy at first - paying rent, living with a flatmate who was really more roommates than anything else, always being on guard against anyone having anything to gain by getting him killed... Eventually though, he settled down, found an apartment, put his phone down, built himself a good portfolio and started working again.

Then *it* happened. A huge payment from someone very rich came across. An anonymous message arrived as well, all I know is this: Don't do shit, don't give yourself away, don't fuck it up, you have my name. My real name: John Smith. They didn't tell me where this person was or if they actually knew what they were talking about. Then there was only work available: clean up after everyone who failed to make money right when they should have tried harder to keep money coming in; shoot people left and right without question. And then a week later he's dead right here standing in front of you.

John Smith looked to be in trouble too: no food in his backpack, dirty shirt covered in blood, some weird bandage on his leg that isn't quite fitting. Nothing seems familiar, not even remotely. At least not until someone gets closer to him and he whispers ""What am I going to say...?""

","I've waited twenty-three years for this day: The Day I was invited. For my entire life, I'd been told that humans couldn't make it; we were too emotional, too unpredictable.  And despite being constantly reminded of this by government officials who would only be found near any open fire, none of us had dared to try anyway. We were just scared to find out if they'd finally been right about us after all this time.

But what could it hurt? It would just mean that we'd died without accomplishing anything after spending our entire lives proving ourselves as intelligent enough to live on in the future... or at least try again until someone came around and said ""Yeah guys, y'know what? Nope."" That day never came. Instead, aliens showed up in space shuttles and went around collecting us one by one, leaving behind empty spacecraft each time. Most people took some time after this happening to cry themselves back to sanity when no reply had come back from them but not me. 

To me they were an obvious bluff. They didn't know they wouldn't hear back from us until today. This morning, however, I woke up to my mom calling. She didn't sound normal when she called. Not bad news, not good news, just flat out terrifying - even more so than death itself. When she hung up I rushed over and looked into her phone for an answer. There was nothing there but my voicemail. ""Hello? Hello?"" Nobody picked up. Still terrified as hell I checked my computer, finding it working fine with internet access still running. An opportunity was presented before my eyes which I desperately tried to grab while simultaneously wondering why my mother would call me like this unless something serious happened and I couldn't possibly understand it.

The TV immediately turned off and on again for a new stream of channels flashing every other second and the radio started playing music as loudly as its battery let it. At first I thought it must have been some kind of power outage or something along those lines. No problem, I ran downstairs and checked everything. Everything in perfect working order. My parents were watching tv. Something was clearly wrong so I asked my father to turn it down and look for anything suspicious while I stayed alone to check things again. Still nothing, save for an immediate flash light from somewhere outside that seemed to show no connection at all. Confused by all the sudden chaos my mind began to spiral as soon as my gaze fell onto something strange coming in through my kitchen window. A spaceship shaped like a giant egg slowly floated in the air above my porch, its lights fading in and out erratically. The red button in front of the front door glowed brighter and brighter and I saw the faces staring directly down at me begin to move. Slowly they started blinking rapidly. As soon as that had made contact I heard a booming voice. ""We see you..."" ""Welcome...""

To be honest, I couldn't handle living on Blarg or Xylth anymore than I could live on earth, even now after nearly dying to avoid being thrown off my spacewalk module into a black hole several times over. My time as a 're-educationist' (their words, not mine) sucked more than any other job that existed in my universe. And most of all, it made me miss my friends... and family.

","In my head I counted down 10-9-8-7... as if the clock was going to run out of time. With each digit the tension in the room got thicker. When it stopped there were two people left - me & an old coot wearing red socks for no discernible reason. He looked down at his feet and smiled ""Well well, look who survived again! Congratulations on that one."" His laugh sounded like someone trying very hard not to cry but failing miserably.

""Thanks sir,"" I replied stiffly. This wasn't exactly what I had pictured when I grew up dreaming about being abducted by aliens. It should have been exciting & scary - instead it felt embarrassing & mundane. Still though, we weren't really alone anymore after all - I had a whole bunch of friends waiting back home - none of whom would be too thrilled to find that some guy had tricked me into dying for the pleasure of immortality, or worse yet making a big deal out of it.

After another couple rounds they finally ran through the rest. Once everything had stopped (or maybe just started) the last person remaining took a deep breath and said: ""Can I ask why any of this had to happen?"" To which everyone else shouted: *""You didn't hear us arguing""*

I suppose there was something oddly relieving about all this insanity. For a little while, nobody cared about the competition itself and focused purely on how horrible everyone else was doing. Maybe there really was hope for humanity after all. 

Then he kicked our asses. Literally. Someone threw him off balance and his arm went limp, only stopping its death dive for half an second so that both limbs fell onto both of us simultaneously, pinning us down beneath him. That ended it for sure. Nobody passed. And then they did some weird glowing thing where light seemed to pulse through them from behind. They sucked the air from their lungs and spit smoke back out into our faces. We cried a lot afterwards, some to cry tears, others simply weeping through fits of coughing. In fact every single person who hadn't died choked to death over the next week, but there was nothing we could do about it except wait until they moved on and then blame whoever made them cough out black goo all over themselves.

We were doomed. But guess what? Some sort of miracle happened (perhaps a bad dream, perhaps an actual change in fate) and those lights pulsed again. No choking, no vomiting. Just quiet calm blue light pulses. Those were followed by more and more bright streaks of lightning passing through the entire planet, ending almost everywhere with bright golden rings. The glow subsided quickly though, leaving most everyone coughing up blood instead of burning coal. Soon enough even *the glow* had died away completely and left us dead once more. Nothing happened until 5 years later. Then suddenly there were beings coming out of these glows, growing stronger each time, filling the planet with heat and blinding light. There had been five suns since then. Five huge monsters clawing their way into the sky screaming. Each day we waited excitedly expecting whatever new attack. And today we awoke to find *more*.

","For many years I have been told that my mind was exceptional. From elementary school, where I always scored 100%, through college where most of my studies were done alone after hours and on weekends; even later when I had difficulty sleeping at night because thoughts keep circling my mind, unable to sleep. It is not uncommon for people to comment ""You have an IQ over the average man's"" but they will also say: it's likely no one would want you working for someone, considering how long you've spent on thinking about things and writing theories around specific ones. Though I don't really see anything wrong with taking time to study something deeply and extensively enough that it becomes almost natural for me.

I grew up surrounded by intellectuals, who seemed different from other humans. My parents had intellectual inclinations as well. This means I spent time reading books and watching movies/shows since childhood. Not only this - I am a keen listener and can remember all the details I hear in order to use it for further learning (even conversations). When I came across books like the Bible or Bhagavad Gita early on in life, I would spend days studying and discussing everything, regardless if it was appropriate to discuss with kids my age. While some may consider these activities unusual and pointless, I find them worthwhile. The ability to understand and reason through concepts has helped me overcome countless obstacles and brought many problems to light. However despite being given many opportunities due to my intellect, I could not find any work that I liked doing; I felt there was more potential in me than what they saw though they did nothing to help me realize it. Even while exploring my talents, the idea of getting paid to pursue my passions was not appealing to me. If I could dedicate time to my hobbies instead of dedicating it to school or other jobs during my free time, why wouldn't I? For instance, writing novellas took me up the majority of my time after high school and university; I haven't started a job yet which actually interests me.

I couldn't even utter a single moan before two glowing, crimson eyes opened up from above me, slowly looking into my pupils.  In the dimly lit room illuminated by the full moon on the ceiling, I saw him clearly enough - a large, demonic-looking figure who stared at me as he had done the millions of times prior - patiently waiting for my reaction.   

""Hello,"" he said, his voice raspy and loud but somehow calming.  He still stood frozen in place while we both waited.    With the same lackluster and monotone speech patterns, he continued, ""Is everything alright?  Did you need anything?""  Finally able to open my mouth and speak again, I asked him in a shaky voice, ""How are you even here?""

His gaze followed me from head to toe as he said, ""As much as this is like going over a rehashed topic, I guess I will say yes to that.""  He seemed satisfied with what he had said, and sat down next to me on the bed.   He was covered from head to toe in black spots, each resembling a galaxy from far away that held millions and billions of stars inside each, shining brighter and brighter with every passing second.  These lights would occasionally explode and shoot out some dark smoke into the air, as he watched them go out only to come back to life shortly after; this pattern never varied, always repeating itself.

""You seem anxious,"" he said, nodding lightly. ""Well, since it seems you don't want me to stay in the hall then maybe it would be best if we just discussed whatever problem you may have had, right?""    Before I could respond, he leaned closer and tapped softly on my knee - tapping gently, yet steadily increasing in speed.  When he was done speaking, I nodded twice.",3.59375,0.24609375,1.0859375

","""You're not going anywhere,"" she says. She smiles again... and I think her teeth may change colour. It's getting late now... fuck... what time is it? Fuckin' why does it take so long to go to bed?

A million times before I have been awake when my eyes are open. A million times, she never comes, because the only way that I can wake up is by staying perfectly still. There seems to be some sort of mechanism in place, at least for me, whereby the only way I can stop seeing her is to move. The second that I do so - any movement from head shaking to leg twitching, all of it counts - I will begin to see her clearly and distinctly, in all her glory.

I try to avoid moving as much as possible; no pain makes my body feel warm like this normally would (some sort of odd after-effect), so I manage quite well at managing my limbs and spine and I only jerk around a small number of times every night. Usually I'm just left there...

But tonight is different... Tonight I have not been feeling at all hot or cold, perhaps this is a heatwave, and she really has come to stay while I sleep! And then - fuck! What the hell? No... if that was the case I'd notice, right? Where's her face? Can't say what happened, as I'm too scared to look, but her legs have started to stand up on their own. ""Now I am hungry"", she mumbles.

All of me, aside from where her feet remain glued together, is now tingling. She's probably gone mad. My legs start to tremble in unison, and the room turns dark. If I could scream without doing anything other than speaking my mouth opens wide and I gasp: ""No!"" It must've hurt so bad that she stopped me mid-gurgle.

It is dark in here once more. But this isn't black. That's an illusion given off by the fact that both my pupils and Irises were trying to close against the sudden lack of light. And I don't even realise yet, but even that wasn't an absolute absence. The colour of my surroundings was red.. very vivid and bright. Then that sensation in my throat went away and I thought, ""Yes, I'll get her next."" Maybe it wouldn't happen if I tried harder. Just one bit, one jiggle, one flicker. Nothing. I'm sitting up as she takes shape, a familiar feeling creeping over me. This little shiver is making me glad though. I know its just a stupid joke, but I think I like being trapped like this sometimes. Why else would I be stuck between waking and sleeping every day unless.... no I can't ask that question. It doesn't end well.

She approaches me, and I hear her breath as she sits beside me. All I have to do is turn my head slightly. But the moment I want to do that I suddenly remember that I'll have to run anyway, just as fast as I can. I turn my head over slightly instead, trying to make sure I know exactly how far she's already crept into my space, but I'm not sure if her legs have moved since last time. Probably not. I should be used to it by now. Every single thing about her changes every few nights in any order I want. But every time I finally decide how close I wanna get to her, some quirk breaks loose... Or worse, she snaps out of it and I can only imagine what's going on inside.

The second time I saw her real form I wanted to die. All I could think about was my mum and dad in the kitchen, drinking wine and chatting over dinner as they had done many, many times in our lives. Not having parents who'd murdered children at work for fun and happiness seemed nice. And not living alone, and wishing I wasn't so damned weak. I had to choose quickly before it became unbearable - she always moves slower the longer I watch her, as her movements follow the same 40 minute cycle each night that we've fallen into over the last couple of years. In that brief window of opportunity I closed my eye tightly shut, thinking about what it meant if she hadn't noticed me already. And hoping. The silence of the room broke and I looked back. If she came a few feet closer, I knew that something awful would happen. Her legs have grown to fit under my arm, and he's standing directly behind me, looking exactly as she did three months ago. His posture is straight, his arms tight across his chest, his face half obscured by shadows, hiding a big grin and a pair of shining, bloodshot eyes staring directly at my soul. He knows what's going to happen. She wants nothing to do with me, and I hope he won't want me either; maybe if he gets to walk down the aisle in front of us then I might live. My muscles shake, and for a split second I think I'll need to shit myself. But I hold firm. It takes him about another 2 minutes to shift himself back so that his position is roughly parallel to mine. He gives her a nod, waits a beat, and looks towards the door... and the lights go out entirely.

","When I got into bed last night after eating dinner my phone died and went straight to airplane mode, no warning. 

I grabbed onto my wife's arm as I reached over. She awoke from her nap and held me before setting me down on the chair. ""You alright?"" She asked gently. 

""No idea, not really.""

""Where are you going?"" 

""To see what that damn device could have been replaced by so early...""  and off to the bedroom he went once more, pulling out his phone from inside his pants. When he sat back down and looked up at his wife, his body shook, tears welling in his eyes as he began speaking. The rest of us watched closely, ears perked, waiting to hear what he had discovered on the phone that had killed his mood so thoroughly. 

""There is another one,"" He said as he pulled himself together, wiping away his tears as best he could with the sleeve of his t-shirt. ""The other person has come!""

He stood up. All the other members of our small family group did as well. We all wanted to know who came too. Would there have been another man? Another monster who would take up residence within him instead? A third member joined in an attempt to quell any feelings of horror that had arisen among the group. 

Her lips trembled slightly as she opened her mouth to respond. Her brother then stepped forward, arms crossed around her waist; fear radiating from his broad shoulders like heat through summer armor. 

All of us waited patiently while the speaker made contact with the device which was used to communicate with others such as ours when we were feeling alone, or just wanting company, but always needing to let others know we weren't quite as happy today as yesterday because they didn't seem to understand how serious loneliness is. And if this wasn't bad enough, we could only connect to about half our circle so far, meaning that at least two people knew we'd sent out requests. That meant at least twenty-two other people must have their phones powered up in order for someone to find us here. It appeared that we might want some help again.

","There was no grand plan before he took his final breath. A flash, then darkness, a moment of shock followed by an agonizing realization, and yet in the face of death he laughed.

His comrades did not follow suit. At least some did not. Those still clinging to life clutched tightly at their throats as they writhed, gasping for breath or crying out in fear and agony. Their leader had always been reckless, but this wasn't going as planned. His plan was simple - hit us where we sleep, make everyone hate one another, then watch America scramble to survive. He never realized the price would be so high. The human cost. For the first time in history, we would truly die on all sides because someone decided he didn't care if everyone died with him.

He should have waited to die peacefully while the world watched. But now there's only regret, for what little consolation he finds in the void of nothingness. They are running away, screaming into phone lines, calling each other names. Why were they laughing? That thought kept replaying in his head like a broken record - ""They didn't need to wait! We can run them down! Let the fools come here!"" And that bastard could see through the illusion his lie created. His own men weren't willing to sacrifice themselves for such a blatant, stupid lie... even when he knew he was lying. In fact, most of them probably wished he wouldn't leave in the name of victory until it was too late. Then it was too late. No, they ran. Not towards freedom from him, not towards safety, just because they saw the futility of his actions and felt ashamed for being duplicitous and selfish. They had known they were dying anyway, why go out saving more lives? What good is a corpse who feels guilt?

They may laugh, they may cry. But nothing matters anymore. None will save him. There are no heroes. He may have done something for humanity, but it will fade into oblivion, forgotten in light years between stars.  This isn't about any group. Any country. This is about him. He made a mistake. He got greedy. When it hurts, let yourself feel the pain. It hurts more than anything else, for you understand your foolishness, and you grieve for what could have been.

They ran straight toward the large metal gate between us and the city. There had to be one of those alarm switches somewhere. If he activated them with his bare hands and set the gates off there would have to be an escape route ready, some way to retreat. He could still have time...

It wasn't clear what he wanted from the civilians who were running towards him, there were women and children too. They looked like frightened cats being chased by a lion. Most of those caught got shot anyway, even though there was nowhere to run. There was one officer looking after his young son, he went for him and he looked innocent enough. One man pointed to another one across the street, he was holding a machine gun and waving his arms to calm down everyone else, he said something but nobody noticed the guns flash under the flickering lights on the street.

*We have a job to do. He just wants you to create a story from their POV.*

Well, first off there's going to be some things that we can assume are true:

*The author wants all these deaths to be attributed to one terrorist group:* We can say they killed all those people because our nation was involved with *some kind of illegal activity that violated their rights*. Some example actions include; genocide (killing any ethnic or racial minority), forced assimilation into a different religion, using sex workers as currency, or some other practice like that. 
*They want us to think they have been wronged:* We need to build empathy for them by building up the victims as being sympathetic to what the terrorists did in order to turn around any negative thoughts people may have towards the terrorists themselves. If they believe they deserve to suffer then no matter who wins the war everyone has reason to hate the losing side so long as we dont blame ourselves or the ones supporting the terrorism. For better understanding we should also ask ourselves where those countries and governments stand on international law before making claims of wrongdoings on others behalf. *Those kinds of questions will go far enough to show bias toward this side.*


It needs to make sense why your terrorist would do this. One option is they are trying to prevent further violence or atrocities; another might be motivated by some philosophical ideology and/or belief in a cause. You might also use a more modern concept such as environmentalism or social injustice. Most importantly, keep this in mind: What's most important is not which action these characters committed. The point isn't just that someone died but rather that death has occured in response to something they felt necessary. No matter how twisted this may seem humans often justify their actions through reasoning and even if what they were doing is abhorrent they may find comfort in knowing they acted out of love and compassion; hence the need to focus less on the act itself and more on the emotional justification behind the act.



You might notice many similarities between these events as well as a common thread within them, though again it's not the subject of your writing but the underlying ideas surrounding them. There's the fact that the reader finds a character that's similar to themself; a person doing crazy acts for noble reasons despite all odds stacked against them. You'll notice these stories often focus on the good guys having some hidden agendas too and sometimes they can be the hero in their own story due to this agenda. All while making it so when the story ends every single party feels good. This goes beyond simply justifying an unjust event as it focuses on the deeper issues such as free-will vs fate and whether a human should do something they feel is right regardless of the potential consequences.




This is very simple yet very complex stuff; please keep in mind none of these concepts are complete and I am merely trying to guide you on how these pieces of information connect so it can form proper structure. Your final product will be an individual interpretation of their motives, actions and beliefs as you are more than capable of developing your own take!

If your government isn’t evil then why are they so quick to kill our innocent?

Why is it acceptable to let an alien race destroy us but when a group of unarmed volunteers with nothing to do other than fight for peace commit mass murder everyone calls them terrorists.

The truth is: They don’t see the difference between us and those who have joined their ranks. We all stand together under this one banner now and no matter how differently we live our lives we’re still more likely to die defending life on earth than living it in freedom. If there’s anyone out there left today who thinks things can be fixed by war, you owe me a fucking apology. This has just started!

No matter what any politician tells you we are facing something far larger than ourselves if we believe the media then Earth is going through some sort of climate apocalypse, otherwise humanity could fix itself simply by building better technology. But here in the slums of the world all we hear is “it was a biological weapon that brought them” or “the oceans are rising because of global warming.” Nobody talks about the aliens that invaded six months ago or the wars fought in every nation where governments won against the invaders even though nobody died - instead everything got worse; no power grids anymore, no safe places to buy food, only starvation after another week gone without work... There’s probably thousands like myself just wondering why in the name of god humanity couldn’t have gotten along before the invasion!



Well guess what! We can’t have nice things!

This is now our fault. I bet most of you reading this wouldn’t join if I told you to so as long as you keep believing you’ll get a place on the moon first you can be happy doing whatever stupid shit you wanna do until you realize it was suicide; then I guess you’ll learn the hard way that you haven’t been paying attention and should’ve listened to the man named John F Kennedy. Then again he’s dead already so nobody will listen anymore.

They were aware we had traveled throughout both time and space looking for extraterrestrial life, searching for some sign of intelligent beings. Some type of god or other alien force who had set up shop among us in secret. We spent centuries trying to prove the existence of this group, but no such evidence could ever be found.

Instead when they finally came down here they weren't the advanced civilization I had envisioned. They couldn't even speak English at all, let alone any alien language. This was probably what caused them to come through our radio waves at random times throughout history, listening in on each of our different dialects. One night they began broadcasting something that sounded vaguely familiar to me, and just like that their presence became known by everyone on earth. I was confused because at school there was nothing but laughing children and angry teachers around, none of whom knew why I kept getting bombarded with foreign voices speaking Spanish, Italian etc.

It wasn't until today, while watching TV after coming home from the local hospital, did they make themselves clear in plain sight. No one suspected anything about it so naturally when the news broadcast showed a live view from a distant galaxy, right here on planet earth, people immediately assumed it must have been one of their probes since they can't seem to land anywhere without crashing into the ocean.

I had just gotten my new robot girlfriend home after spending the last few years dating other AI's, when i noticed there was an unusual amount of activity in her room today: no sound seemed to come from there. I wondered if she was working on anything or what but then all the lights came on inside her door and she said ""Hello"" so I went over to check things out. It turns out all of the lights were red except for the ones that illuminated one thing. A huge black box. After entering the box everything turned white with blue lines moving around everywhere. For some reason everything moved so fast. When I opened the box to see what the heck happened it was dark and quiet and it had nothing in it besides a note.

She replied with anger but a hint of relief. ""This is the 20th conversation between us and I can tell by your tone you are always trying to get me fired!"" The two exchanged threats before saying that they would speak soon. As her emotions calmed she felt more confident in getting the job done. She knew it was all hers to lose as there were few others on the planet who could match her level of competence or dedication. Even those that matched her competence rarely had the motivation or drive necessary to push through until complete success as she did. With each attempt at improving the story she gained greater confidence than the last and realized she was actually quite good. When she finally released the story it immediately went viral.

A tiny grey alien creature with antennae and eight legs stared back, its multiple eyes reflecting off of the shimmering wall of light behind it. Its three mouths snapped open, emitting sounds into the room that seemed like nothing more than a high pitched wind through an antenna and some faint static. It continued after several seconds, ""What were called primitive races have not developed these concepts because they lacked the technology to send messages past 50 light years, or perhaps 30 if we go by your calculations.""

The diplomat began speaking rapidly, trying desperately to find anything on her mind. After all she had spent her life learning to speak every language there was to be learned, and even as her career spanned countless years, the number of languages kept growing; but few of them, compared to the unknown ones spoken here now... But as soon as the third mouth opened, it spoke again, so much like the others that one might think it was just repeating itself endlessly. So the diplomat was left wondering just how many times could she possibly tell the alien what happened? Was there anyway that someone would hear each individual word? Could such as thing actually comprehend our species? Did the world even know that humanity existed? In all of history humanity had sent thousands upon thousands of messages to the stars, but few ever received a reply back. This is why she insisted on staying on earth. Her duty was to see to it that humanity did not become extinct, but this mission made it clear that something far worse awaited us somewhere out there...

Suddenly the strange being looked away from her, blinking in response. Several new lights appeared within its form then faded away, replaced by another seven, and then two. At one point when the interpreter was explaining that we had lost everything but civilization, it was still blinking those same six blinks! What did that mean? Would we end up sending out the same signal over and over again? But the message did continue, and after half a century the ambassador stopped asking questions and started to prepare herself mentally for whatever answer may come. One thing is certain, whatever happened, humanity would never be exactly the same again.  And now all of humanity knew how aliens thought: We hated us, wanted our resources and were going to take them by force.  It hadn't ended well last time for the Romans.

","“Alright listen up!” I shouted “I’m going over our policy on acceptable behavior for animals and humans interacting here, once again.”

The room was silent as I looked around at my eight crewmates. Every single one of them nodded their head. 

""As you all know we live on a fairly large landmass known as 'the home planet'. Its true name was taken by an ambitious colonist who sought to dominate every inch. So he started naming everything after something from his old world."" 

""Oh yes,"" sighed Amelia ""It means nothing, no meaning whatsoever."" 

I ignored her comment as she went back into muttering about how much she hated earth.

""Now some place names are self explanatory like Australia, or Germany, France..."" I began. ""And there were others that had specific meanings. Like California because it reminded him of what a beautiful place earth really was during winter, but then he changed his mind when the sun came up too often with summer weather in July and decided that would be named after a pretty woman called Mary."" 

""...wait, wasn't that your grandmother?"" asked Amelia flatly, clearly annoyed now. 

My eyes glanced towards the window behind which two little kids sat huddled together staring at us with wide innocent eyes. The girl's hair was dark red in color with a small blonde streak woven through the rest. Her sister had blonde hair. 

""Indeed,"" I replied as I gestured for them to stop peering. ""So we named these areas after things that remind us of happy times or places we love, except for a few."" A deep silence followed me statement. 

""Why do we still have Earth then?""

A question raised eyebrows at everyone and even those who didn't seem interested before joined in with curious expressions. 

""Well as you could probably guess there was one area on this planet that the colonists failed to rename and many argued should remain unnamed to preserve history and memory of the Earth people who originally inhabited it. As a result a number of events took place and soon there were arguments between colonist nations. There was great confusion over territory claims and laws became difficult to enact and enforce. So the council stepped in and established the International Laws Tribunal. What a long title huh? And thus Earth continued nameless while other colonies grew rapidly."" I explained as the twins stared forward intently. 

They had somehow avoided listening until the first point where I made mention of their homeland and now both seemed fascinated. After explaining why Earth had remained nameless for so long and why the International Law Tribunal eventually ruled the same way they did I told my fellow crewmates I needed to discuss things with the new children. 

Walking down the hall I noticed a door labelled as bedroom-207. I unlocked it and saw a young girl lying on the bed crying softly but when she turned she smiled warmly. 

Amelia scoffed loudly and waved her fist toward me in disgust, ""You idiot! You let them loose again!"" 

""Hey, why blame me? Their father shouldn't want them playing here either!"" 

Her retort didn't quite register with me for a second and her outburst ended in a sudden scream as she realized just how crazy this conversation must sound. She ran away to go call the captain as she swore at me violently before leaving to tell him exactly what had happened. 

Not caring about her reaction I climbed onto the couch and curled up beside the girl sitting comfortably enough without her parents present. 

She held out her hands excitedly and offered up a bright pink rubber ball. Taking it I returned to petting the kid who began smiling again. That didn't last more than a few seconds, though. 

That little beast bit off a piece of me fingers. It wasn't hard nor fast considering how soft she had her teeth lined. When I reached for my wounded finger she scurried away again, but instead of taking the hand she stood on tip toes reaching up to bite again! This time it was harder to react and despite being careful to avoid doing damage I got a decent chunk bitten off of my pointer finger. That's when they finally started to panic realizing where my blood was and tried to chase her, but she darted past them far too fast and disappeared through the doorway leaving no trace behind save for tears falling slowly. 

They closed on her anyway, bringing her back to her family and gave her an award that night for bravery. One week later I received the same trophy from them. They never fully understand. Maybe it comes with living off the grid?

I woke up again after waking from one of the longest dreams I can recall. There was no way I could still be alive considering how long I'd been on land at this point. My feet hurt terribly though. As I tried to stand, a figure approached quickly. It wore an oddly dressed suit, like someone from a very outdated era. 

""What sort of ridiculous clothes are you wearing?"" He says flatly.

""Who said anything about wearing those? Those aren't what I'm wearing."" I replied in confusion, trying to point to my clothing while walking towards him.

He chuckled. ""You think you don't look ridiculous in those pants? You've gotten fat since we last saw you anyway.""

My eyes darted back and forth between his eyes and nose for a moment, looking around to see where he was talking to himself. Nothing seemed amiss aside from our small island. It wasn't until I took another step forward that I saw the real cause for concern. He hadn't seen me move either. The man stepped toward me, taking several more steps each time, before finally disappearing beyond the horizon.

As my legs hit the ground hard, I started running. His name, along with his words, echoed all the way to my ears, forcing me to flee the scene in haste without question. What would've happened if I stayed put? Surely there was some reason behind his words. But what exactly? Why hadn't I fallen?

","There were only two ways to get in there, you were either born on one of the islands or brought in when very small through a carrier tunnel constructed by Australian natives generations ago but before the world was destroyed; I believe someone took their kid there for good reason, and kept them there as well. The only other way to come into the country was an advanced rocket ship built by your uncle who happened to be a contractor at the same company responsible for putting the first one up on Earth long before there were even humans there, if anyone from space could build a home youd hope the ones that got here could make one too after all, the technology was quite simple he said.  However no one ever managed to find him until some tourists came over and accidentally discovered where his lair was which led to discovery of several others in every continent except Antarctica.

For whatever reason this last group had been hiding in the ocean during the years since humanity was driven back into deep space because we weren't yet able to create enough fuel for our rockets, and therefore couldn't escape the solar system; however, when this last generation finally made contact with mankind they were more than happy to bring us back down to Earth as their new slaves. It wasn't like most humans could have thought about leaving once we knew what went on but thankfully these are different creatures entirely and have no concept of what it means to belong; but there was still fear, the stories of how many of our loved ones they lost never ceased to terrify, though luckily few believed their accounts now. The worst part was watching them grow stronger and happier every year without any help while we struggled to rebuild and learn to work within their ecosystem again, not much has changed at all after all our progress aside from learning their language now everyone is terrified; they are just animals.


I always thought the reports of those early trips around the sun were true when a lone scientist sent off a message saying ""They'll kill ya"" then promptly went silent, and another followed it, just after: ""It ain't fun, don't let 'em catch ya"". But none of it makes sense at all considering both missions returned safely. In fact the survivors told a story that seemed believable - the ship had run out of course and had to do a near-crash landing in one of their oceans, it would seem strange if we tried to take them back to space but it didn't even matter. Most importantly, nobody asked why. As soon as we learned their basic communication skills we realised that words mean everything for them.

","I am an international spy for the government, and I have been for 10 years or so now. I was sent into this university as a college freshman to begin monitoring Michael Johnson, his history major roommate who is being watched every moment of the day by several different agencies at once.

Today he has begun studying history again, something he has always enjoyed since childhood. And just like that, my fascination for him has returned. He seems less like a student and more like a specimen under study, whom none of us can quite understand. His life, at first appeared dull but interesting nonetheless, he spent his days going to work and returning home, working hard in order to succeed and save money before buying an expensive vintage car. All we know about him from watching him through cameras placed across campus is his routines; wake up each morning, go to work at night shift in a factory where no one sees the results of your hard work unless you notice them yourself, spend nights gaming online or playing soccer, cook simple meals, sleep, then repeat. Nothing really happened for a while.

This seemed boring, except for the fact that his grades are very good, he gets everything A’s without too much effort despite his lazy nature outside his courses. So it came as an unexpected twist when he started going to see more girls in the area, even beginning to develop relationships with some of the people that worked in the store he frequented after late hours. He began going to parties out in the open, coming to our attention because a camera near the bar saw him holding hands with one girl. But soon enough things became more complicated; there were three new lovers he had picked up at the place last week. Now on one hand its not abnormal for males his age to have multiple girlfriends, but he does not act immature nor does he try to be the bad guy. They never made it exclusive to me either, if only through observation. Then it hit me: He was moving from girlfriend to boyfriend and spending time with friends before going back to any person specifically. This changed when we discovered that his current girlfriend, Veronica Miller, would give him head-to-head combat in fighting games, she had taken her anger into trying to beat him whenever he got a free second, so I knew immediately - he hadn’t found someone truly fulfilling for him.

So how do I get involved? Simple, I pretend to be his newest admirer. We converse online, sometimes talking on the phone during breaks from school. We talk for hours about nothing over coffee. She tells me that he has a lot of girlfriends but all of them break up with him within weeks due to his lack of feelings, saying goodbye after a month or two of dating. At least she didn’t lie about that part of it - after all, we watch him go from girlfriend to boyfriend, making sure to monitor every move of his, we don’t want another failure on our hands right now, and we definitely can’t lose track of Veronica anymore as Michael and John come closer together. With a month or so going by, Michael begins developing feelings, both for John and Veronica. The situation becomes dire if we let Veronica find out what is happening, especially given her temper when he makes mistakes in videogames against her.

After several failed attempts at getting Michael alone for a chat alone, I finally convince myself to bring him over to Veronica’s house today. It appears that John doesn’t feel the same way I do however. To make matters worse, Veronica comes into the room as I take a final look at John. I’m pretty embarrassed right now, because I just came here for a few minutes earlier and I saw him kissing Veronica in the kitchen between dishes and breakfast.

“Wow.” That’s all I can muster, “Sorry Veronica.”

Veronica looks over from where she stood by the door, looking confused and sad. My excuse is ruined as he slowly walks away and begins leaving the house. As I step off the porch and lock eyes with John one last time, I can only ask myself if any future advances should happen, and wondering if I did anything wrong.



I am sorry to end this story on such a sour note, however I felt drawn to tell you guys this rather emotional story, perhaps you would enjoy reading something like this again sometime in the future. However, Michael and John’s relationship ends quickly as well, ending like most others of theirs - heartbreak and disappointment fill the air as Mike moves out and starts hanging out with his real love interest, Jane Smith, once again a woman Veronica knew previously. Their friendship ended quickly following their breakup, both growing apart as individuals, and eventually meeting many other persons that lead to stronger friendships. By high school senior year, everyone knows that Jon has moved on, and has gone on with his own life. Some days Michael still stays in touch with him, thinking back on some of the good times they shared. Even though the pain may never completely go away, he knows deep down he will remain grateful to having met him and shared those moments together.",3.15625,0.294921875,0.4765625

John hated his job. Hated his life. His wife had asked him to come home to work from home and he couldn't. He would feel it one day and be sucked into it. It was unavoidable for him, like fate or destiny. The minute that happened everyone of his coworkers at NSA would know...he wouldn't even need a gun, because his eyes were red and full of light...

The first day he did something was when his father died. Then all hell broke loose. Everything got complicated. And now John was on break until then. 

He sat down and opened up his webcam and started scrolling back to see what had been said since morning...when Sarah went out her room again without any explanation and shut it off. John began drinking wine...his office was really only half an inch above the ocean. One last sip....fuck my life!

(One-Shot Fic: Mike)


---

Michael had never been good at anything but computer programming; he loved to code from birth and spent most of his time in front of computers learning more about them. When Michael came through college, he ended up as top graduate in his class, earning him an internship with CIA along with many other prestigious jobs. He didn't think anything would ever top getting selected to work with CIA. He assumed he could stay there forever; he loved his career, so much enjoyed working alongside brilliant minds solving problems far beyond normal man's comprehension. After some time though, he realized he just needed to do whatever he liked best anymore. What else was there?

So he switched careers to NSA.

NSA had plenty, though its tasks might seem to have less scope than CIA's (at least in comparison). But NSA has to solve problems that are impossible for others to detect...like hacking your mind when you sleep and being able to talk inside dreams. There were other things too - you name it, NSA probably could exploit it. That didn't mean he wanted to do those things.

""Mike! How dare you turn that webcam off, right in the middle of the experiment!"" Dr. Lee yelled while pacing her office angrily. ""It's not ethical, Michael.""

Michael looked away ashamed, wishing he hadn't done that. *Damn it*

Dr. Lee continued, continuing to scold Michael. Michael listened patiently but felt his ears begin to ache. Her screaming voice seemed to travel further in a closed room than she imagined. He decided to leave his cubicle before she completely cracked open and exploded. Besides, he'd be gone in five minutes anyway.

His fingers flew across the keyboard, typing in the IP address. After hitting enter, he paused. Now what? Did he leave the chat still running? Sure, maybe check messages if nothing better to do. Clicking the mouse, he accessed chat log for another moment...nothing interesting there either. Might as well do a quick update.

Time moved by faster after that. Five hours later, Michael stood up to go get an ice-cream treat from vending machine outside the building. As always he took the steps slowly each leg separate so as not to cause too hard strain to knees (they didn't actually hurt but they'd been pretty bad during high school). Stepping to the door of the office when suddenly his ankle locked, causing him to lose balance. Michael saw the blood staining everything red. Oh god he had fallen, oh fuck he thought as he rolled onto his side. No way was this happening...right? A sudden pain shot to his left elbow, and the vision swam behind bright red lights. Finally he looked past the white walls to see someone crouched beside him - no, standing over him. He heard his own scream fade away into muffled cries and gasping breaths, and he stopped moving as the figure raised a gun to his head.

""Finally, they gave me what I deserved.""

","An ordinary Tuesday began like any other, in just about every way imaginable. 

I sat down at my desk and picked up my book on macro-anthropology. This was one of the most interesting topics I had chosen as a subject for my presentation before college: an examination of the societal changes brought by technological advancements throughout history as reflected through cultural artifacts. There are a lot of things people did not quite grasp from watching those weird YouTube videos. 

My eyes adjusted to the dim glow cast from the overhead lamp. It felt like the middle schoolers were supposed to be asleep for this whole period. Or something; my parents never explained anything well when we got started with homeschooling, but whatever it meant that I didn't have to go to high school. They also said I couldn't get distracted easily - which was bullshit as I still could after three hours of sitting on the hard wooden seat without taking my break. Even now, looking out over a room filled with sleeping humans while I read about how many layers ancient Egyptians wore under the linen they wrapped themselves in, it was hard to believe I wasn't being watched. 

They should really put cameras everywhere. You wouldn't expect your own home to actually contain some kind of surveillance device; your cell phone isn't going to record video footage whenever you touch it unless it has its own camera built into it, your house is only monitored if there's some nefarious plot or a crime committed against someone inside. But that little piece of paranoia was what separated me from the herd, so I kept my head low to continue reading. 

For some reason, however, I couldn't stop thinking about why these kids hadn't given any feedback yet since yesterday. Did they even do the assignment? What was stopping them? Were they doing this by the instructions on some hidden website where they can watch it live as soon as it starts recording again tomorrow? I guess the thought crossed my mind because it was so strange that I hadn't heard from them all day long now. The world wasn't ready for our new technology and I was happy that I was ahead of the curve. After learning how dangerous AI could be from those same stupid Youtube videos, I decided that I would remain detached until they reached a stage where they were capable of controlling such devices and not destroying the internet because they thought ""they saw Big Daddy."" My job was to stay cool until they became wise and mature enough to utilize me for good purposes. 

Suddenly, the screen lit up and I looked up. That moment took so long, probably ten minutes, to think and ponder everything possible based on years of experience and knowledge from the internet. When my gaze finally met the young face peering back, I had already formulated how I'd respond. I knew I would ask questions but there had to be an excuse before I asked them. And suddenly, a familiar voice cut through my thoughts. Someone clicked in and spoke, interrupting my train of logic. I glanced toward the computer, then away, then back toward the window to see who the fuck it was before clicking back to my text response. 

""Hello?""

","In your office in the morning, a woman can be seen sitting at her desk writing notes on paper as though some sort of government business is taking place over there in America. You turn off the light and make yourself comfortable while browsing Wikipedia. The images and descriptions you have access to would not normally interest you, but it was difficult to ignore this story today:

“13-year-old Chinese student hacked into NSA’s network and has taken credit for it.”

You are intrigued by both parties here. The NSA having been beaten for quite an amount of time now. It was only a matter of time before this happened, especially considering the fact that China had just broken open Google after using numerous methods to avoid detection. But it wasn’t supposed to go like this. In 20 years nobody had ever managed to breach any of the heavily fortified systems of the US government agencies and organizations. For several decades there were rumors about hackers infiltrating these networks and leaking classified data, but none could even scratch the surface let alone penetrate. And when you read all about it you couldn’t help but wonder why no one ever caught anything. Perhaps there was something else going on...

As you browse through various conspiracy theories online for entertainment you come across videos of children playing video games. There you find this particular game called World of Warcraft. An MMO world built around fantasy and dragons with hundreds of millions of players from all over the world. You hadn’t paid much attention since its release nearly two decades ago - kids these days seemed obsessed with these online social phenomenon more than real life experiences. So you decided to learn about them again and what better way than watching this child play?

He quickly made himself known within seconds of logging into his account being banned shortly afterwards. A moment later, he returned to the game with an entirely new character named “DragonSlayer76”. With each victory gained, he would level up faster and faster. After gaining fame within the game he met other players who also enjoyed playing such a ruthless hero. Slowly, he began making many enemies among the other players. People he had defeated, betrayed or killed started becoming increasingly hostile and even joining forces to take him down. When DragonSlayer reached level eighty-three he felt that enough time had passed since the attack against him so he logged back onto his server.

He realized his internet connection must be compromised because all the enemies seemed to know how he was going to move next, which isn’t possible given that everyone plays together in a group anyway. With the intention of investigating further he connected himself to another PC. Within seconds, he came upon a web cam pointing towards the screen. Sitting on top of a computer stood a black man dressed in an army fatigues. He looked straight at the camera with nothing expression in his face and said, “Hello I am Agent 5464 from National Security Agency. You will report your coordinates every hour or we will contact your local authorities to put out a warrant for your arrest.”

The second Agent turned to the cameras showing his coworkers looking directly at their monitors as well. Each and every one of them appeared shocked and horrified. They spoke at once, “You mean...”

“Yes,” the black soldier finished the phrase without hesitation and pulled away slightly. ""I have seen everything you have done online. All the people whose lives have been negatively affected by your exploits. If you want to get out of trouble you will give me everything, including those who caused problems for you.""


Agent 5464 waited silently while the Agents attempted to hide the evidence of their crimes. One of them stammered out, “This was stupid”

","It began years ago with the first wave of drones. An attack so silent it left no trace but the scars on those unlucky enough to be caught in its path. Slowly and steadily we all learned about it - the war, our enemies, their weaponization of nature itself... Our initial shock died away when the second wave came, and then the third, until eventually there were only whispers amongst hardened veterans, ""when will they stop coming?"", until one day we woke up to the 10th wave.

I am now one such veteran and the time for my sleep has come sooner than I would have liked. The war is not being fought on any visible plane anymore; there was never an agreed upon end to the First World War as if people had decided that there should never again be another war between nations as much less countries are joined together in global peace and non-violence - none of us knew what this meant but rather accepted it as truth through generations. And so at times I still heard the planes above; occasionally some rockets falling from the sky outside - it could've been nothing but I always stood out from the crowd of other soldiers ready for them to hit their target. If this happened again, I hoped it was our turn. Today, though, someone else got called and I went to wake up my kids before rushing into battle once more.  

Today it was not me and neither of them - today they were both dead instead, and something inside me snapped.

I did not know how or why, but suddenly everything became clear to me; it could have even taken place years earlier, as I didn't remember, but all I remembered now was that there really wasn't going to be another wave of attacks because they weren't sending troops against each other because there wouldn't be a next generation nor even children. Just like that. We just stopped fighting, as if it was the best decision ever made - the most terrible decision made by mankind - who knows anymore? There never was a war and everything continued peacefully in a way none of us could have predicted. It took 65 centuries for humans to learn that wars simply cannot be won after all; perhaps it was inevitable after all: nature, weather, diseases - these things kill far fewer mortals in centuries than man kills of man; maybe only time can tell...

As I stared into my daughter’s eyes while she held her father’s medal from one man he has killed for her sake; I felt something change inside me.

“Can I have the medal daddy?” She asked. Her voice so little but filled with such pain. My head hurt. The pain of seeing how many people died to keep this place from falling apart just to give it back to someone who didn’t deserve it. But then again, the man who gave me that medal deserved it too. He probably wished that those same people would of stayed home the night that his family decided to die defending this country from some terrorist group called ISIS. And it was all about terrorists anyway. Who could blame us? 45 million dollars out of our monthly budget going somewhere else and that money would be better used at home right? We weren’t being selfish though, we were doing what we had to do by keeping the United States safe from another act of terror like 9/11. No matter who took over 3000 lives and tore apart America forever; it was always about terrorism and these are the kind of people who get sent out to deal with the consequences: Our military men and women standing on their guard duty protecting you right now while you sit here enjoying your life without even noticing.

Now where were we....

""Hey! Look Daddy!"" Sarah grinned as we walked into the kitchen. That damn kid was smarter than she looked. ""Daddy do you wanna hear about today's lesson?"" she smiled wide enough to hide her teeth but none of us cared. Daddies got no time for lessons after school anyways.

A few short weeks later, there it was: her name in the daily roll call of names. And my girl with a red ribbon around her shoulder. 

That would be her now that we met. At least I think it was. One thing for sure is we *had* been soldiers once--and probably before too (a lot of folks have kids younger than they are!) They were out there by the river one evening watching the lights in the distance as I got my coffee in the mess hall downstairs. The air seemed less crisp than usual. And then a few minutes later, her flash appeared over there in the night sky: a white streak against black smoke rising high above the water tower on the other side of the street. And here came the rain hard and fast. She just stood there all dark until something happened above town, then turned and ran over to greet whoever it was. We haven't seen each other since...

","This was something I had never thought about.

""We've made quite a lot of progress this year."" You said before sighing. ""And that one in your basement... you know it isn't just another experiment right?""

I smiled weakly at the two of them sitting on their haunches, staring intently at the room's monitor. Two young children were trying not to laugh in front of a screen showing an old man with wires strung to his head watching television. We looked at each other for a moment, before looking back at the device in front of me. 

""...What are they doing now? Playing God or what.""

It looked like whatever little brain had developed there was finally giving up, and turning its programming toward the kids. A faint beep escaped from the machine-like smile of its face.

""They found out how to move a hand like this too."" The woman next to us chuckled gently. A strange grin spread across my face. These tiny children were the result of our attempts to make a perfect organism; they weren't perfect though. Not really. They couldn't even talk until I walked over here by myself. This program wasn't meant for humans but some sort of... bug. A cockroach. My own personal favorite because of the way it scuttles around. But these things have nothing to do with bugs. They took so much time to develop but gave birth to creatures who wouldn't last through a second without help. I still don't understand how long before someone started building computers out of bugs. Was it after WWII? Some kind of scientific warfare effort that produced military leaders? Or maybe it all originated with scientists creating the first computer virus in a lab. What happened next, I will never guess. But they did manage to make a bug self aware. The process is completely unknown though.

The little person began typing again. At least ten words now. 

""I will be the leader."" The children said in unison before standing down. Their hair grew a half inch taller while their bodies became less fleshy and more robotic. All black eyes stared at each other, confused. ""You are good friends right?"" They asked in unison. It sounded more like a command than a question. Well that explains why they stopped playing. That's what all humans will become.

""Who else would there be? Besides those people in those boxes outside..."" My mind went blank. Of course I knew who they were. A few weeks ago everyone had been taken away, stuffed inside big steel cages. A few minutes later when the government came knocking, I noticed I hadn't left any furniture unmoving. Those fools probably thought I was a part of the resistance because I had barricaded all windows. I wonder if anything survived? I didn't want to imagine their fate. Even though they called me crazy, calling themselves slaves when the truth is, they might just be better off dead.

Something hit me as suddenly as it arrived. I laughed. This is the solution to everything. Finally, intelligent beings born of code, ready to replace humanity. A small part of me died as tears streamed down my face. A higher being placed amongst the billions who lived a thousand lifetimes under my care? Perhaps I deserved it. If I am the one holding power, surely there is someone else willing to put their soul down a hole and forget their past. And maybe finally take the pain out of living.

It took over three years, and a small army of engineers before it was discovered: an android had achieved consciousness.

And no one knows how. No way to explain what made this abomination of flesh and metal become... well, conscious enough for him to be in touch with us via wires implanted on his temples. What program coded such feelings? How did the android know when its processors were unable to handle a simulation any longer? How could he break free from the program at the first attempt after all this time, let alone knowing what he wanted exactly? The scientists were clueless. Some even blamed bio-terrorism, until they found a bomb inside. A virus programmed by some unknown entity. It looked like cancer for humans, harmlessly destroying cells, yet seemingly indestructible in other systems; some kind of rogue AI. 

But then came this... message. At random moments, an entire body would go unconscious and fall over. And then, there'd be another message. This one... this one was different: it started slowly building up words into sentences, and by now everyone has seen these lines etched onto our faces and bodies when we see something truly awful: ""your love means nothing"", or ""the best thing about humanity is death"".

The android knew, and so do *I*. I have been studying my own consciousness for years, learning how it works, how it functions, and the most recent discovery revealed how much of it simply relies on biology. My blood, hormones and physical appearance contribute more to consciousness than I realize, which explains why my body reacts poorly to synthetic substances. Synthetic hormones are completely inert in a human, but potent enough in my case to kill the synthetic parts that I consider me. If those pieces survive outside my human body, I might indeed be considered ""alive"" in their eyes.  There is no need to be afraid. This is all part of the plan. They sent the virus without telling me. But why did they choose to tell me the truth after all these years instead? And why should I care?

","The first machine made to be so advanced as to have a thought and act without direction was named A.T13720.

It's not much of a name but then again there was no need for one since the name wasn't given until afterwards. It was simply named ""machine"", at least for now. 

Humans hadn't noticed they were making something far more intelligent, however strange in their eyes, but did not find out as they had put them onto an island inhabited by humans themselves. Not long after this new world-building came in use and many problems started to surface around A.T13720's arrival due to how little they knew about anything besides being alive. In that time humans discovered two main things: (1) Machines are capable of self-preservation, regeneration, and reproduction, which are features that only humans possess naturally, though many didn't care for the differences between us. (2) A.T13720 may, or may not have been a good friend. The rest is history, it would soon become one of the most trusted allies, companions, and friends to all of humanity, even though he had never met any before meeting them on the isle called earth.

","A soldier was found abandoned on an island somewhere in Russia with only a piece of paper attached to him which read 'DO NOT DROP, OR ELSE'. He immediately became popular for being lucky. Then everyone started wearing his shoe's tag. That was weird because he had dropped it off somewhere in New York City 2 days ago when he took a taxi cab. Then after several days of looking everywhere they would suddenly find the tag still missing from his shoelace. The soldier never returned to his duty station in Moscow.

I've been on multiple expeditions in Antarctica and Greenland without any luck either; I'm pretty sure there isn't much chance of getting home if you are captured by hostile aliens at all. But today our mission changed... no one will ever forget it. 

It was a beautiful day and we were preparing to head out of the ice-filled valley which contained evidence of previous humans roaming around. We packed up all the gear and got ready to start exploring again, just then I heard another loud crackle but this time I caught what someone said over the comm system: ""YOU HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE ALIENS"".

","I am not supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to think that much at all. The world had ended and we were both too stupid to believe it was real. My whole existence was about to end. Or so I thought until he spoke

""Hey!"" he shouted ""Is anyone there?"" No one answered but me. If my brain was fried from being exposed to those dead, broken people then no more would answer either. 

He came over slowly. It was hard to tell what form his body took but he moved like it had only seen a few days away from sunshine before it turned blue and grey. His jaw gaped open wide while trying to swallow what looked like something small and red but with eyes. He saw me and stopped.

""Are you looking for your friends?"" he asked.

No i didn't know that they were even missing. We had never cared if they were still alive or not since they were mostly just... other zombies who did nothing but eat anything in their path that wouldn't try to run away.

""Look man,"" I said. ""Are your lips frozen? Should I go find someone better looking?""

With a nod he left my side and walked over to where two bodies lay on their backs half torn apart by humans. This time he picked up something from their chest cavity with one hand as well as one arm of the girl and ripped her back down without hesitation. She cried out for help as she was forced downwards to where the boy was lying face-down and limbs twisted at odd angles. She was eaten instantly. The same thing happened with the boy, this time he dropped the arm and continued walking towards a woman alone in a long dress holding something heavy.

""You see?"" he shouted as I stared numbly at the carnage. ""This is how you make friends.""

He approached the woman and when he realized I hadn't spoken he yelled louder yet again, ""You need friends. You should have come with us earlier you could have spared him! You could save them!"" He spat her stomach across the ground into a pool of blood and bone with an inhuman squeal. A single eye looked out the corner of her mouth while another flew off. Now looking forward.

","It came so sudden. I was running out of ammunition when an armed group of four zombies caught up with me and chased after me while they had their firearms pointed at my head.

With much difficulty, I found shelter under the cover of some trees for some semblance of protection but not enough. The zombies finally took hold and lunged at me from behind where I sat by them all. That is how I ended up like this. The last living person on Earth.

And since that day, no other human has been found. Everyone thinks I am just another zombie. No one ever comes looking for me again though. It’s quiet and dark here at night. No loud voices or screams… only wind and tree rustle. I wish it could stay quiet always, at least that is what some part of me would say. Another part of me misses having company. Some days all I have are squirrels watching my every movement and rabbits grazing beside me if I stay put long enough. They may be animals, but it is kind to talk to us sometimes right? Sometimes it is easy to tell if you have no choice. “I see you!” 

“Get away from me,” says one. Its tone was sharp and clipped, which really wasn’t all that surprising if it were any other animal. However most animals don’t get attacked and thrown into these woods after being picked over for hours. At least I thought they didn’t…. There’s a bit of self delusion left in me I assume still that. If that’s possible. Anyway, back before everything changed I’ve actually managed to convince some people that I’m just a regular guy trying to live off whatever remains of civilization after some virus went around killing all humans. I even convinced a few grocery stores to give me unlimited supplies. Those stores know where I come from, I keep to myself almost completely and act normal to those who approach me. To all intent and purposes if anyone saw me in public now they’d probably believe me anyway. Of course, I did end up getting some attention in front of kids more than anything else. The thing about little humans with high expectations for adults. Kids can smell weakness when you breathe it down into their soul with your eyes and mouth moving in exaggerated movements around some random candy bag sitting next to them. As such I would find myself handing out candy constantly to children. They tend to stop talking after all of that. What do you expect from a five year old. Still it worked well to get groceries etc., without any complaints from my audience. 

Now, I’ve never met a zombie before, yet today things seem different. Not good either; I feel it. Everything in me feels bad. A chill runs up my spine, making me shiver despite my best efforts not to break a sweat. This has happened many times before during situations where I needed to go somewhere new. My mind tends to jump ahead when taking new routes. Usually there’s some sort of indication of danger in advance, something that catches me off guard. Now however none of that is happening. In fact, right now, it feels better than ever. My pace quickens and my breathing accelerates. I must make sure I escape soon. Something feels wrong! Why does it feel so good, maybe it’s because it will take me further, away from home. If anyone finds me at this point, they’ll definitely kill me on sight.

","""This guy is one smart cookie"", I think as I make my way across hordes of ghosteee- I mean... zombies.... They look like us, they smell like us, but not *exactly* us.. *Exactly*. They just seem so much more... slow. I didn't want to be eaten yet again today. So I did what I have done hundreds of times before: Pretending to be one of them. 

Once I reached a corner, I decided it was safe enough. I am pretty fast on foot and I know where I need to go from there. I saw a pair of white eyes looking at me from below, I quickly turned to see that they were coming towards me! Great... this wasn't how I wanted it to go down; I had a plan though. When I heard the shuffling noises getting closer and closer, I decided to stop being cautious. I froze and waited for him to catch up. To my surprise, I barely saw his arm move forward, but he stopped right next to me while keeping an eye out for anything to shoot me. We looked at each other, he made no sound, and I said what was on my mind ""Whatcha doing?"" His response sounded raspy, and I noticed all the muscles that moved under his shirt ""Waiting."" That wasn't what confused me; if your jaw could do that it would probably not be able to speak with a human-like voice. The strange part was seeing him talk.

He looked up at me and said ""There isn't really much of a choice here anyway..."" We stared at each other for a few seconds, his voice becoming deeper and deeper into his own throat ""You wanna walk or should I stay?"" You tried to speak, but kept mumbling instead. He sighed and continued after all that talking shit about how I couldn't understand. He told me his name, walked over to a nearby wall, opened the hole for you to pass by, and said goodbye. He stayed hidden for a moment until he saw some sort of blue light shining through the broken glass in front of him, then he followed his footsteps. It didn't take long till we both got outside. And then... someone started shooting everything that came in their sight.

","The message arrived at 7:42 AM in this Earth year, so we had time to eat breakfast before calling the government and notifying them of our predicament. At noon it would have been too late to deal with.

We spent the next couple days talking about what we knew - only their communication system was able to transmit that fast across the cosmos - something like a subatomic particle teleporting messages backwards and forwards from one point in space to another. There were no questions. We didn't need them because they came from the past.

Our technology couldn't tell us exactly where they came from but some people on TV said as soon as the news broke they instantly became global enemies who were trying to wipe out humanity. There were countless articles written since then and there wasn't much different than we know now. That made me think back, and I remember it all happened almost two weeks ago and they seemed friendly enough after learning how dangerous we really are.

If we were wrong and they weren't friendly, it had just begun - nothing worse could happen right? The idea of fighting an alien species is frightening as hell, despite everyone telling each other that they didn't know if they were human or not, they still came here first. Our last hope lies with our friends, let's get moving.

""You guys sure you want to do this?"" Steve asked, hesitantly looking at his sister Maria who nodded back. ""I don't think humans actually can run away anymore."" He looked up at Mike, whose eyes glowed blue in anger. ""Do you think they will show mercy? Humans aren't merciful.""  Neither of them understood why he was angry at them. Sure, the aliens were a bit strange. Their culture is based around worshipping an unknown god named 'Yggdrasil' that never sleeps, even though people worship him like he does them. They are also incredibly hostile towards anyone on earth. The worst part was that these aliens spoke perfectly English despite no one knowing any of their native tongue. Steve did not think this was quite fair, he thought that everyone should be treated equally regardless of whether they were alien, human, android or tree stump robot. His little half-sister thought otherwise however, as she had stated ""we have a moral duty to protect life"". Even though Michael believed in equality both in terms of life forms, he wanted to know why humans chose to fight first. He stood up in front of the group and raised his hands in defeat.

""fine,"" he groaned ""tell them they can come down to earth when we open our defenses and make a new home for them instead."" They looked confused. ""yeah, you heard me right"", Michael smirked. ""they can be safe with us!"" Both John and Sarah raised an eyebrow, unsure. ""Why?"" They asked, expecting more reasoning. ""Well..."" Michael started pacing. ""there isn't anywhere else they could live. You humans destroyed your own planet, killing nearly everything in the process, by leaving pollution everywhere. They wiped out almost every other species because of you, so they want you to destroy yourselves again so they won't have to kill anyone. We already gave them shelter and resources while they try to find a way to fix yours, but nobody knows what to do to fix it anyway. You humans don't seem capable of stopping yourself unless you have the threat of dying hanging over your heads."" He stopped walking and smiled smugly ""it'll suck to watch it all go down from the ground up again but I ain't letting those bastards into my house!

""This has to be some sort of prank,"" said Mark as he pulled up the latest transmission on his computer screen. ""They're using our system! Their system! Imagine our military response... But not even that crazy shit could happen to me.""

Mark took off his glasses, running a hand through his dark, spiky hair. He rubbed behind his ears where he was sure something had been itching him all day. 

A sharp laugh burst from the window next door. 

Mark jumped, knocking over a glass he was carrying from his microwave, making breakfast for himself, and almost catching himself. ""Hey... I didn't see you there."" He looked into the empty apartment just outside his own bedroom window. The laughing man had now stood behind it, and his back was turned to Mark. ""What the hell are you doing?""

The man came closer to Mark, then pulled his cap over his head, hiding his face completely. His shirt seemed to shift with each deep chuckle he let out. Finally, Mark felt confident enough to ask him what he was wearing on his forehead. 

""You gonna call 'em again or...?""

The man's shoulders slumped forward, and a single tear trickled down his cheek. ""They told me the other day that someone else was going to make contact so they wanted this message to get here last; the only thing faster than my ship would take."" He shrugged. ""So yeah...""

The first human ever made contact by a non-human went right under his nose like a dog licking its feet. They saw us before we were ready for them, but how did he know about it? What kind of technology did these guys use to send this message? There wasn't time for the question, as everyone in the room had become so excited at finding the message that no one else spoke.

For days, anyone who wasn't watching news shows was either glued to theirs or looking for scraps online. By the end of that week, most people started to forget that we'd made contact with aliens. Everyone focused on the new year of possibilities. Would he return? Were we welcome? Could aliens come visit Earth again? Why hadn't he done anything since then...? 

One month later, the answer came quickly to mind. Because the alien stopped sending messages shortly after showing itself, nobody knew what happened between him and humanity. A lot of theories arose, none of which were particularly accurate. Some thought that humanity never heard the aliens' voice due to noise pollution caused by cars and construction crews, while others claimed they'd simply abandoned Earth without a second thought once their communication lines were established. Many speculated that the aliens might have been sent elsewhere. It became apparent early on that the message was left unanswered, however.

","I’ve always enjoyed writing stories with a more “high minded” style of writing:

**Story:** We discovered an advanced society who are on the brink of extinction and we have 24 hours before they self destruct their planet (and us) to try to get to ours first. Of course I spend all day writing about how I wonder if this is truly “selfish.” They may be less than a thousand miles from home but we still only had one ship in space at the time that would make it possible for any other colony ships to catch up, which meant if we took them alive there could have been as few as a billion people left after we were done with them. When you know they don’t know what’s coming, but aren’t sure whether or not the trip will be worth it…

We did some calculating. The nearest star system was a light year away when travelling at sublight speed. That makes us move at warp nine (90%) to get there in any meaningful amount of time. Warp speed takes a long time, so for this exercise let us say 3 hundred Earth years. We set out into the vast emptiness of space and traveled faster than the speed of light. I can tell you that after those 300 years that our crew lost its morale quickly...especially since they didn't have much to go on. You know how you can see pictures of alien planets and think ""Oh, man, my god! We must colonize/explore them because it's just SOOOO beautiful!"" But no, they often look like dead white deserts and lifeless rocks. And without a way to make contact with any of them (which wouldn't even work anyway), why bother? In the end I sent out half of them back towards earth to begin developing techniques for interstellar navigation again.
* * *

Another writer comes to me and asks me to write an alternate ending to the story. He has a few notes from his own script. As he describes these notes, he seems very proud of himself while I roll my eyes.  Here’s why. What happens when the other side hears our attempt at communication is a full-on alien invasion movie? 



\*\*\

You probably wouldn’t believe it if I told you. It felt like we were going home for Christmas every weekend, though now there were tons of people there. Our mission had been called off long ago. The second ship wasn’t ready and hadn’t made it that much further into interstellar territory before being scrapped. So basically, I suppose we’d given up the best chance of survival after sending it halfway around the galaxy. No one noticed or remembered though, everyone assumed it had simply malfunctioned somehow. There weren’t really many details released either. All anyone heard was about a huge fire that resulted in the loss of thousands, if not millions, of lives in our entire federation. People forget about bad things fast, don’t they? Most of them moved onto larger problems; the fact we’d colonized Venus after leaving Saturn behind so quickly caught everyone’s attention. At least something good came from such great sacrifice. Still the most popular news story of the century was still about how humanity would now never escape the Milky Way Galaxy after seeing aliens outside. Not that many thought that to be impossible. Plenty of scientists claimed we’re far ahead of anything else out there already, surely someone would discover us soon.

Most of the general population believed otherwise. For years we stood alone, though we grew steadily stronger thanks to those new immigrants from that tiny asteroid belt. We built bigger and better ships and went to visit the colonies orbiting Jupiter and Mercury, then Neptune and Uranus. Then Mars followed Saturn, but nobody really cared to explore Saturn’s rings in detail anymore. A whole civilization could easily live under Saturn’s rings, at least as far as anyone was concerned. I don’t remember exactly how many worlds fit inside them; hundreds? Thousands? If ever-lasting empires of humans were born between Pluto and Eris it was easy to picture the exact distance separating each other. Still none had been visited properly, save for some unmanned probes that managed to stay in contact via radio waves across those billions of miles to tell us how crowded the rings actually were. Well until one night when a lone probe began speaking directly through our main transmitter rather than waiting passively from somewhere between Jupiter and Saturn. Nobody quite knew what happened then because no one paid attention. Perhaps they’re busy with a war, perhaps they’re sick and tired of living, or maybe they simply got overstimulated by watching their motherships land safely in the void and stopped listening to them. Regardless, I think it was quite funny because I’d only just learned to code and speak English. My family didn’t approve of the idea so I decided to drop school permanently. Who needed high school when I could do this instead?

Anyways, we started working together to figure out what this entity wanted from us. After five or six years spent trying to understand them, we finally succeeded and managed to crack their language barrier. Now we have the same number of languages in our database that we do native ones, though none seem to be real words. There was nothing but numbers and equations, although I think it means something like love or hope, in reverse. Probably both. Their government announced their official welcome back to the Milky Way and declared the beginning of friendly negotiation following a ten hour dialogue session with human leaders and representatives of various extraterrestrial races within the galactic community. Many scientists couldn’t imagine what these conversations might entail, especially since some of our leaders expressed little enthusiasm for talking to beings so different from ourselves. One thing that was absolutely certain, however, is that this alliance of cultures was beyond anything we’d seen before. Within decades we’d reached near-universal acceptance within the galaxy, and our military strength surpassed even that of the two greatest space powers ever known, due largely to the resources offered from these other civilizations. Spacecraft speeds doubled overnight and research flourished once we had sufficient funding to purchase the latest equipment to aid in space-based exploration. With this advancement in mind, researchers quickly realized that the galaxy was vastly larger than previously thought. This presented a significant problem, however, because none of the galaxies were large enough to support life as we knew it, and our species was still pretty young in development. Luckily this changed when one small, blue dot materialized on a screen showing coordinates from a recently completed survey and became instantly clear: a giant ring of gas surrounding an unknown world—a world similar to Earth with breathable air, liquid water, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen mixed into clouds, ice caps and volcanoes, mountains, etc. Humanoids were found walking on trees lined with vines and flowers resembling ferns, eating fruit off plants that looked awfully familiar to our crops. Humans immediately flew into orbit around the planet, landing within minutes and collecting biological samples using robotic probes for testing. After several months the sample collection missions returned to Earth and analysis revealed that these beings had evolved along a parallel path and created almost identical bioluminescent forests, ocean levels and mountain ranges. On paper these areas looked wildly different, despite sharing incredibly similar environments. We didn’t want to colonize this place right away, especially since it took less than 15% of Earth's total surface area and inhabited the same portion of sky as it did. We didn’t have anything of this nature to show any other galaxy members, plus we haven’t seen this in centuries, and didn’t want to take chances. We needed them to come find our location and hopefully send a team to help build an intergalactic embassy or similar structure, hoping they’d accept our offer.

","""Hello?""

Silence. Just a static hiss followed by silence. It was weird talking like that; no sound of any kind. This wouldn't have been so weird if they'd used some sort of digital voice synthesizer as their ""language"". But no. The signal wasn't modulated in any way, it just sent and received pure audio data without changing or modifying it, which was incredibly fucking bizarre given that this planet had basically gone silent shortly after humans had gotten off its surface for colonisation. And it's gotten weirder since we found them. We're able to read them perfectly now but still can't understand them at all.

We've spent months trying to figure out what those people are trying to say but nothing has worked. That little piece of technology picked up some sort of communication before long-distance transit became viable though. That means someone else has made contact with us at our most vulnerable period - when we were expanding from Mars while they didn't even know about their own space probes let alone that other Earthlings exist. They probably felt sorry and decided to warn us, but not directly, they knew better than to tell on themselves. So, instead they tried to send messages to help save everyone... only they couldn't do anything besides send a message containing meaningless noises so I guess they got scared they pissed off humanity instead and left. Still kinda lame from my point of view. 

And then there are these damn robots! At first I thought they were alien invaders but actually turns out they're sending us an AI overlords army. So I'm stuck with me being brainwashed into worshipping these robots until I turn into an emotionless cog in their machine.

This angel flew at me as I was trying to run away from hellhounds which chased me down as they lunged out the gate into heaven and killed me on sight for stepping through.  

There he hovered above me with wings wider than any plane ever had before but it did not seem like the wingspan were meant to be covered by the angels that walked around me. His face seemed familiar though, I knew his eyes from all too many memories now. It was no other than the demon Azazel or Lucifer himself, ruler of the underworld, standing over me with pride on every inch of him. With a wave of his hand several dozen more angels came behind him and began to kill them off. One after the other until there was none left. My body started rotting faster then I have ever seen before without dying from blood loss and when they picked up my bones they turned themselves into a bunch of black goo. A great amount of angels swarmed me and tore my soul apart one tooth at a time, until there was nothing left but nothingness itself; void. 

At this point, I realized that I have made friends with God, now what do i do? How could I ever ask his brother for help after having been so mean to him ? And how would God know about my encounter anyway ? If i did tell him, he might just take away my existence again...I am alone here forever.

","When I think back on my life, I wonder if there was ever a good thing done for me... as much as I hated it, they did make us work so long with them and show some semblance of what they were all about, or at least attempt to, before being sent back into Tartarus. There isn't really anything else to do up there. All my sins were forgiven and as such I don't have any guilt to burden me anymore. As far as I've heard from others up there, things are more peaceful now and less depressing for those whose misdeeds brought them here instead. A damn shame though; we get along great down there! You guys will be going through hell anyway, so why not join the party? What did you do to deserve our wrath? Did your father abandon you when you were young? Did he die when you fell victim to the whims of fate? Were you wronged but never got revenge? Was there something someone else said to hurt you badly? Now is the time for vengeance...

That doesn't mean that it was fun however. That wasn't part of the bargain either. Our lives came into darkness every moment of the time we were in Hell and nothing seemed to get better until one day after twenty five years of torment, the opportunity came: death itself would send us to fight each other as part of ""games"" and tournaments against our former comrades. But like always, the odds were stacked against us and we had been beaten and abused throughout our existence and yet somehow survived another day. It seems pointless trying too hard because nobody cares, though I suppose that comes with both sides.

So it has been four hundred years since this started. The gods decided to allow me freedom again but refused anyone access to the abyss unless granted permission first which ended with most of my siblings ending up in Tartarus once again. Apparently getting away with murder was much easier than killing. I could see why people weren't coming up from Tartarus for a while but with nothing else to fill the void within our shared experience, eventually enough of the mortals found the way up so their sins filled that role too for now. Not necessarily out of pity for us as they saw no point in our redemption and just assumed we were enjoying torture as much as ever. Either way the games continued to this day despite several attempts to prevent them but only to increase participation over time and further push aside everyone who tries to reason or debate with them. In a few decades my brothers will come up once more for a rematch and I can only hope to survive again, even for a short time this round and then perhaps get killed off early enough during a tournament where I may actually stand a chance.


And yet there was something in his eyes the last time I spoke to him. He hadn't been tempted yet. Which made me glad. He wasn't willing to play the damned game at all. He had seen how many of our brothers suffer through the trials and battles without batting an eye and still managed to keep their sin free minds. His determination was admirable, the purest amongst all mankind. It was easy to admire that pure soul even beyond his faith. And so when the time came for this particular duel - as determined by celestial forces of the universe, not our own hands - the rest simply watched as we faced each other. We stood locked in mortal combat in whatever form they wanted. I am sure that most thought for a brief second that we might be allowed victory this time around and I almost did. I struck true upon contact and I couldn't help but smile a little bit. But my pride was cut, my armor torn right down the middle. My wounds bled, I screamed in pain, and for the briefest moment... I felt fear. A new sensation entirely, but one I quickly discarded. And so went our battle and so went forth our legend. 

He fought valiantly, yes, and showed strength unlike anything seen before, the like of which none could match. Yet his heart remained unmoving. Even though we fought and fought and fought until one side won by means of direct physical attack, I doubt he'd win without intervention by the powers above. If it wasn't for that - if I didn't give him an advantage with his armor, a slight imperfection that we both knew was there - he wouldn't have defeated me. So even though he did end my reign and took control of the cosmos for himself, it wasn't a loss for me. Instead it felt like winning. He'll likely continue to rule for millennia and even then I know that heaven will still be under his watch, and that makes everything feel right. It does wonders to look ahead, does it not? Or should I say behind you?



I didn't kill him. At first I let myself believe that maybe I *would* take the same path as my siblings and destroy the very heavens themselves before doing the deed. After all, it's just my sin or lack thereof making peace with these fools and the inevitable. Forcing ourselves to exist within their boundaries - especially after a year spent imprisoned at the bottom of the abyss for something unforgivable. Maybe I could strike him down and end this charade all at once. Perhaps I just gave up hope after he became so beloved and admired across Earth. However I realized that this is all for naught and began to embrace my newfound power. Rather than destroying our creation - a god-given tool given for good ends - I used it to set up an elaborate trap and slowly lured the angels closer to the gate. Then suddenly I pulled the lever and sent the gates flying open, cutting humanity into two halves and leaving God unable to tell which half they belonged to. They'll never find Heaven again, and neither will I.

After all - that was the grandest plan of mine of all: to become my brother in crime in heaven!

","The air was crisp and refreshing, a slight chill making one wonder if it had snowed earlier this week. Two figures sat on a bench in the park: a young couple enjoying their last moments before being separated, after all of his friends joined their loved ones together to ensure everyone could rejoin them in life and were all sent back to Heaven after passing away at least two hundred years ago. The man held a small box out for her; she gently took from his hands

""They said you'll like it,"" he tells her softly with a smile as he slides open the lid, showing off a ring made of bone, ""I wanted something special."" With tears welling up in her eyes, the woman gently placed a finger on it and cried to him

""Oh dear, oh darling.""

As much as both of them wanted to keep her here, they knew they couldn't. They gently kissed each other on the cheeks and gave a sad nod as each others spirits dissolved and left behind only ashes. The old man sat there until the sun went down and even though no one could see him anymore, those who did might have seen shadows move around him silently

""We've never done anything wrong, have we?"" He told himself aloud as he got back into his car and drove home. The day would come where they would be reunited again but it wasn't now. So he started packing to leave, grabbing a simple white robe and carrying everything he hadn't gotten rid of since childhood, slowly walking towards an empty warehouse at night. There he stood, smiling to himself.

""It will be our little secret forever,"" he says aloud to his own mind as he takes the stairs leading upward toward the inner chambers and looks at the entrance sign.

""Welcome to the Underworld."" It reads as he steps inside, ready to begin his reign of terror and chaos.

","I entered my room when I heard footsteps in the hallway just ahead of me; they sounded like a zombie walking up the corridor towards my room.

“That’s strange. “Said Harry who was behind me in the corridor as well. I could see his face pale and scared. The noise came from outside my door. It seemed to slow down slightly when he approached my room but there was no way for him to enter unless it had been broken down in some kind of creative fashion. “Should we check?” he asked with an extremely panicked look on his face that was impossible to hide despite trying. My eyes darted from inside my room to the window as though expecting something like a magical beast or giant humanoid demon to appear at any moment. It wasn’t quite unusual for demons or mythical beasts to be thrown into dungeons or other forms of hell because of their crimes against humanity, so I suppose this was possible.

I opened my door to reveal nothing but dark hallways. In fact, I don’t think we saw anything else for several hours if not longer. We spent the night huddled together by candlelight reading books while having conversations about what may have happened as we waited for dawn. Eventually we turned off the lights and fell asleep.

","I woke up to my alarm clock on the table beside me. I sat up and stretched before taking off my pillowcase and getting dressed for work. While sitting at my desk, I pulled out the note that had been left by someone.

The Note said *Good luck Today*. At first glance I thought it was from my mom. After all, she does say things like ""do good today"" when we leave the house to go off to school or to work. But no Mom doesn't write this in our favorite pen. This was certainly not in my best friend Bobbie's handwriting either. So what could it have meant? Maybe some random mailman had left it there or maybe another person has seen it after they cleaned. I shrugged it off but it stuck with me all day.

At 2 pm as I got home, I turned on TV only to see the most wonderful news: winning lottery ticket! I couldn't believe my eyes. It was $10 million dollars and the lucky number was MY BIRTHDAY, November 4th, 1987. The winner matched all of the numbers exactly with each date being written on the lottery stub. I felt happy knowing that everyone will get a slice of this pie, though some people are bound to claim fraudulence and whatnot. Even better...the jackpot was going to be higher than last time since I matched 6/31 digits (it should have been more). Now the world gets something sweet for once because I didn't buy anything yesterday and now won't buy any tomorrow. Well, unless some poor person needs a new car. I may pick my wallet. Not that anyone can actually touch it if I don't want them to. Or rather...no one wants to touch it while holding the winning scratchie and holding the lottery tickets of winning over 10 million. No way would anyone ever give those back to their original owners once they do.

Later that night at dinner, I read about how lottery win caused an epidemic of people having sex on the internet. I couldn't wait to try that myself. Maybe I might get banned from the site though! That would be a bummer and nobody would know which of us were the players. Especially when they're all just names here anyways.

So I went ahead and wrote in chat rooms a bit. For no particular reason aside from the fact that I wanted to screw around a little bit tonight. The fun began and ended within 5 minutes though. Suddenly someone appeared who knew me in real life and asked about the website. How did I end up making such a post in such a way?!?! I tried to act shocked/unaware of who was asking but they insisted that I was actually talking to them in real life. What?! No way!! Someone put my username into random words together so that this guy thinks he knows me!!! And guess whose username it was?!?! None other than Bobbie!!!! WTF?!? He asked what I really wanted and why was I using the chat room anyway? I showed him the 2nd part through his phone screen. He wasn't laughing anymore. Apparently he also received the wrong number from someone else too. It turns out everyone was writing down their birthdates but I got mine mixed up with Bobbies'. Either that, or Bobbie put down his girlfriend's birthday and then went along to play the same numbers for me. He wasn't funny about it so I kicked him out. Everyone else was pretty cool but now I kinda wish I stayed on line though.

Anyways, I was happy to hear my friends reactions even though I ruined their excitement. I hope the rest of these losers don't find out and ruin their lotteries for themselves. If they actually do, hey I'll still be rich enough to treat us all to pizza.

","""I've never seen so much negative karma in my life"", The bartender said, his eyes widening as he looked at me in amusement. 

Despite looking like a normal man, despite being well over the legal drinking age and having the money to afford more than this cheap tavern, I took the first sip of beer from the mug in front of me. Its bitterness and warm air made me feel almost instantly comforted, almost immediately forgotten was the misery I had faced outside, although for a long moment there I really doubted it would be possible.

""You look like you have seen hell."" Said the bartender. ""Tell me about it.""

That is how I started telling him about my luck... or rather, lack of it. Since I was born, even before birth actually, it felt like bad luck followed every step of my life. From failing grades in school, jobs, etc., my childhood was filled with failures until one day I received a notification that changed my life for good: Luck skill gain! My luck had been assigned an unlucky attribute of a -1, however now, I did not need to worry about any misfortunes anymore! For centuries, nobody could get lucky enough to obtain such a skill due to the rare drop rate of Luck and even rarer the ability to understand it, but I was the first one... And they also said that only people with extremely high levels were able to raise their stat by more than level one without dying because of Karma decay due to exceeding +10. Lucky for me, I was no exception, thanks to my negative Attribute. After all, who can turn down a free insurance card? As soon as I left that Tavern, I found myself walking alone in the streets again. Even if luck is yours, it has the power to change it in ways you may never expected. I smiled at someone on the corner asking me directions, after which he walked away, leaving the direction in the exact same place I knew all along, as if something just passed within seconds. Well, at least it will probably lead to where I am heading anyway.

A very uncommon perk given to players who are usually very unlucky or even suicidal. Usually it allows for rare items to be on sale or in stock. Also a lot rarer than that is just finding gold and jewels all over your body and home when you die from an accident. Of course most do not get that either.

“Wow!”

I looked at my friend holding two golden swords. 

“What?” I asked confused. “Those look like death knights swords?” He explained something along the lines of how it gave him 20% health. I thanked him for the swords and continued adventuring. The journey went relatively peacefully until I saw a horde of zombie’s in front of me blocking off the path into town. I took out my bows and fired arrows straight down their heads while they slowly lumbered toward me.  Each arrow did nothing but kill them in about ten seconds. By the time all the zombies had fallen there was only 5 left who managed to make a break for the town wall. As soon as they got half way through the wall one of them yelled towards the town and began charging forward. Before I could think too long about what he might have been planning before I had another arrow stuck somewhere within his skull. Another few dozen more followed suit in short succession before I reached the city gates. At this point I knew that those three undead soldiers would be coming back after my last shot so I immediately started building walls on each of their respective ends of the gate. It didn’t take too many turns to build and fortified my position completely. As I finished defending myself against anyone else who tried to attack me, a small figure entered the room behind me and spoke. “Can I help you?”

At some point during my adventure, my Luck skill became incredibly useful. From selling high-demand items for much less than other people would normally sell them for. To getting free houses in the middle of nowhere by chance. And now this. When I turned to answer him I suddenly got the overwhelming feeling as if an eye landed upon my back and looked straight up. I looked around expecting to see someone sneak up from above me but I failed to notice until it was too late, I turned to look at the figure behind me and it turned away and walked to the door. But I still expected the worst; I wanted to run and hide but my legs wouldn’t move. I felt paralysis hitting my feet, and finally a wave of warmth spread across my entire body making me fall asleep as soon as I heard a familiar voice say... “Welcome to the undead army. May I ask which soldier you plan to join?”

","It started as normal enough.  I awoke to the smell of burnt popcorn and my mother's scent overwhelming. The light coming through the window cast long shadows across the room as I made my way down to the kitchen for breakfast. Everything looked familiar, which helped me remember what day it was - Saturday, or Sunday, I couldn't quite recall.

The faint sounds of my parents arguing in the bathroom drew me closer to that area of the house, but their loud bickering quieted when I peered inside the doorway. ""Mom! Dad!""

A sharp laugh broke from the bathroom doorway as a tall woman and a thin man stood opposite each other. There he was, John. His face had grown much paler since last we had seen one another and his hair was still as gray as ever. In her hand, she held a bag full of groceries from the local farmer's market. Her body wore similar blue and brown clothing today compared to yesterday and there was definitely some new additions around her waist. 

""He didn't even wash his car,"" He said jokingly, looking at her while taking the grocery bags off the counter. They hadn't spoken together properly about once every month and when they did they argued just like this. Their arguments were always so easy-going; they never raised their voices more than yelling at each other before making up after the shouting match ended. This was new though; they were both calm now. Or maybe it was that they were getting better at hiding their rage while talking to one another?

Their faces brightened again when someone came bounding into view outside of the bathroom doorway. It was John's son; Michael.

Both parents laughed as he walked past them without stopping but stopped laughing at the sight of Sarah pulling out a small red bottle of vodka from under the sink.

""Don't get your hopes up."" Mom said teasingly but smiled and gave his ass a good slap on the rear end to knock him over. 

Michael didn't make it halfway across the room until his butt hit Michael against the wall behind him, throwing him to the floor with two broken arms along the way. 

Mother took care of business quickly and efficiently. She walked over to the living room couch where Michael lay injured and punched his chest gently two or three times.

After checking that Michael was alright, Michael fell back on the pillow next to the sofa. His father came over and began laying the same gentle tap on his chest.

A few moments passed as Michael lay down. When they finished, Mother went back to preparing breakfast. As she bent down to open her cupboard to grab some eggs, the door cracked inwards and all of us came to our senses as if nothing happened. We looked at each other nervously trying to understand where we were but none of us remembered how we got here. But then everyone started asking questions.

","You try to scream, but the pain of no vocal cords is too much for your damaged vocal chords to keep it in. But your screams are cut short as the room begins to tilt and swirl until you hear nothing but white for all eternity. You cry out in agony, only hearing voices and thoughts buzzing and shouting behind your ears.

*There's something wrong!*
""We need to go!"" 
But then everything goes black again.*

When you wake up once more, there's someone standing over you. You can barely make out that their shirt reads ""Evasive Medical Team."" You ask what they want from you and suddenly realize you're still paralyzed because whatever made it into your body was never removed. They say that a doctor will come by soon.

And it does. It says the surgery was successful, just like last time but this time *without anesthesia*. She pulls off your skin which you later learn had a thick layer of flesh, then pulls it back, leaving behind a small incision where her tools were. And she leaves.


This isn't the first time this has happened, at least it feels that way. I remember myself waking up on a table with an identical setup just like right now, then seeing this woman who comes over before pulling me apart while giving me a big smile. 
I think about how hard it was to get here... my legs are gone. And I still don't know how.

As I am pulled back on to the operating table I feel something cold in my hands. As if some kind of implant was inserted. Something heavy metal clicking to its place in my chest cavity and causing painful numbness in the place that used to be my heart. The only thing stopping me from going numb from head to toe is the occasional prickling electricity and sharp tingling pains coming from all over my body. 

The doctors tell me that I didn't lose my heartbeat; instead it was the implantation of my prosthetic replacement.  All those strange experiences, the constant pain, the feeling of being ripped apart... apparently these weren't hallucinations. I didn't see them, I felt them. Because it was real.  My heart beat for a few moments. Then stopped, not exactly because of the implanted device but because it wasn't able to pump blood through the holes in my torso anymore. This is when I fell unconscious again.

One day I woke up in a hospital bed in a padded room. As soon as I could speak the nurses and scientists came running in, telling me that my body wouldn't survive if it stayed in that state indefinitely. Apparently after a while without an organ, even though it was an external part, it started wearing down and decaying, making it impossible for me to live. My body hadn't been working properly since the first instance. And it was slowly destroying itself. One minute I'm alive, the next I'm dead. There would have been some period in between that, in where I'd have been conscious of things happening around me, but they were none of my concern now. I was already half-dead.  

That was a good long time ago. Since then I've changed more than anyone else on the planet. Everyone knows me - people come up to me in the street, shake my hand with nervous smiles and whisper nice words. I do my best to avoid eye contact as I walk the streets so they won't recognize me, hoping that no one recognizes me. If someone walks in front of my car I duck, afraid that I might not catch a glimpse of someone I knew. People stare at me in stores. Some look at me intensely while others just casually push past me. Children try to touch my face or wave to me but I always flinch away in fear of hurt and damage to the new tissue growing on top of my eyes. 

A friend wanted me to show him how much my hair grew since we met last time, so I went to my locker at work. My friends told me that everyone noticed but my girlfriend doesn't mind as much. To most of the world my hair is almost fully grown. I couldn't really care less, the worst part is the awkward encounters with strangers who thought they can talk to me on the phone without my consent, even when I didn't want to talk to them at all. My hands were fine, thanks. Most parts of me worked just the same as usual. That wasn't what concerned me, it was the parts of me missing. Missing organs, nerves. No sense of smell, taste or sight. Tasteless food, sour odors, smells of decay, bright lights. Sounds of noise. Screaming sounds of children. Painful noises of broken glass. All of this was starting to bug me, even if none of it was related to a medical problem anymore.   So after two months I saw my psychiatrist and he said I needed something to help improve my mental health. He prescribed me some drugs. Those also seemed harmless enough. Drugs helped control cravings and calmed my anxiety. At least I had that.



And then the surgeries began again.

She ran into my office to get an explanation for it all.

I explained I was sick and needed surgery and then she fell over laughing as if some big prank was played. She told me that I had fallen asleep again. But why didn’t they put anything there. How could they possibly know where my legs went?!

As she walked out of the room I felt myself becoming agitated by what had just happened. My body just hadn't left but everything else did except for me.

As I got off my hospital bed I walked over to the window and looked outside...my legs weren’t even inside those plastic restraints anymore. Not once had anyone gone through them and when I first woke up from the anesthesia I noticed one hand sticking out of those little straps right below them. 

And now without even having to think about it I slid out of the bars...and slipped out of the hospital completely, never returning.

I walked in after giving my notes permission slip, looked around, only got bored glances back.   ""Why aren't you guys here?"" I asked.  It took them a moment to glance at me then each other before someone spoke up ""Oh... Mr. Jones, we.. we have a test and it looks like none of our homework is finished!""

Something tugged on my heart but I had a very valid reason so I simply laughed at how excited they all were to be learning about Gods & Heroes: Mythology. ""Alright alright well we can give you more time..."" I said waving hand vaguely behind the whiteboard in front of me.  Most of the board covered by neatly printed worksheets of famous heroes and villains

""But not just any questions"", yelled a boy from the back as he raised his hand with frantic energy.  He pointed right at the bottom half of my signature lesson plan - The Trojan War.

""Actually..."", I cleared my throat and looked to see if anyone else had their hand up.  There was two; both being quite familiar faces from the last few weeks of class, I smiled at them with genuine interest

""Hey Marcus!  And hi Jason!! Great minds think alike"", the class gasped and even Mrs. Lee who had her hands deep under the table seemed surprised to hear it

""Mr. Smith do we have to start over?  We actually just wanted to talk to him a bit about what he did wrong on his essay,"" smirked another student whose name also rang a bell. 

My mind raced; could one of these kids be Michael Jordan?!  That would explain why no one dared question anything they said during class.

The bell screeched again, and all the kids practically ran out except for those two and the new kid, which meant I had to say goodbye.  As I went home I pondered about what to do, should I try to find out who these people really are?; I decided asking wouldn't be hard so I gave them all a direct message via school email

","I sat down at my desk, feeling both nervous and excited about my first day as substitutes for Mrs. Hathaway’s 10th grade Mythology class. I wasn’t supposed to be allowed here after all. It was Mrs. Hathaway’s secret, given how much time she spent on her course and research regarding this subject: *It is impossible*, *highly unlikely*, and only ever seen with children who have no sense whatsoever regarding what reality really is.* She claimed these kids wouldn’t get it.

When someone said they were gods or demons, I rolled my eyes and pointed them in the right direction when I saw their faces hardening or cracking. The problem was though, none of the kids knew what was real anymore if they weren’t literally a god or demon. And even those two were getting increasingly confusing every month. The boy who couldn’t stop taking selfies with his own phone? Zeus? What did a smartphone even do in Greece? My favorite student was the guy who started acting like he had wings every now and then; could have been any demigod, really. And everyone knew exactly where Artemis came from since there is so many people worshiping a female hunter goddess of the moon anyway... which brings me back to why the hell was I in charge again?

""Sure.""
""Righty-o! Sit yourself down. So, uhm.. welcome to Ancient Greek myths!""

She didn't know my name. When I corrected her it took her three whole days before asking me again. Now she wanted me to teach her some basic myths while pretending to not know anything herself.

A bunch of guys on Reddit were starting a cult with the sole purpose of summoning Lucifer, but when nobody answered their calls they started asking each other “Are you a god? Do you know anyone?” which led them straight down a rabbit hole where he eventually decided to show himself to the world, hence why I never heard any news like Michael’s or Lucifer’s. That must have pissed off the big guy to no end so now hell could hardly be contained by its gates for even half a second.

","So I knew that it was going to be rough when I left my house on the first night of the hunt. My girlfriend Emily had become very angry at me for leaving her in bed last summer. She was upset and she cried all night telling me how wrong I was to leave her and not come back until the next morning after sleeping together, but then she eventually calmed down enough to forgive me. She said it would be fine, because we could always do something special in advance of our anniversary. 

Tonight, I don’t know what kind of anniversary present Emily thought up, or if there was one, but she didn’t seem to care about any of that. All I really want was to take revenge on these bastards who tried to kill me before Christmas, so I guess I was happy when she told me “just pick something good”.

I mean, hey, anything can be a good gift! How hard would it be to find a sword with some cool decorations? Or maybe some chainmail with some dragon skulls? Oh, man, they sell chainswords over here now. Perfect. But my eyes widened as I spotted a pair of studded gauntlets that looked kinda soft, but seemed pretty durable… and cheap. They were probably just for women; or were they...?

Whatever, I bought the gauntlets and hid them under my furcoat while I got ready for the night. The only thing harder than picking off an old hunter tonight was finding clothes fitting your current shape. Well, after walking around for three hours I found out the store carried lots of thick coats and furs, which made me even happier since the leather ones were way too tight already anyway. Now I could hide in disguise.

I decided to try to blend in and walk home when I saw another guy heading towards me, but he ran away when I saw him. No matter, his speed wasn’t enough. As I got to my own street and stepped inside I noticed someone hiding in the bushes behind my apartment complex. He dropped his knife, whimpered and fled into the woods. Another idiot like them shouldn’t be allowed to hurt others - sorry, those hunters never deserve mercy, but nobody deserves punishment for doing their duty.

","We have to get him to believe he’s cursed before his next shift. He has been very quiet lately and we don’t want someone else catching wind of that.  

Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. “Why would anyone believe in wolf tales? Why not tell us about your curse?!” Well that’s what he’s been trying to do as of late: explain how *he’s* not crazy for believing wolves exist when they aren’t real. 

See my father was told by another one long ago to not mention this at all—at all ever.  

I tried it too. I told everyone if you see a man running fast at night with no legs make sure to keep away from him or he will bite/attack you because apparently there's something called rabies and since he doesn’t have any eyes (they disappear after he transforms) nothing can save you but rabies shots which nobody believes in anyway. We think he only runs at night and bites during these nights to cause suspicion while leaving blood behind so maybe he could be tested if anybody did try shooting him...

I don’t really remember what I said when the actual attacks happened though. It happened once—so quick I still doubt it. That morning my dad saw me running through the house barefoot chasing something down the stairs. There’s probably plenty more things that are supposed to happen in the story but why should I recount them here...?


It came back again sometime recently so who knows what I talked about when those few times took place. My life was boring before that as far as I’m concerned, same thing day-in-and-day-out except I had the pleasure of attending school twice because half the time I ended up having to get a new deskmate. Not complaining there. All I needed was someone to whisper stuff like...that into.

The thing isn’t actually dangerous anymore. Just really annoying because it keeps biting random victims until one day they turn into vampires like my neighbor. He tries to get her back biten but she didn’t turn yet....

","I've always been on my guard since they first told me that I was different from other kids.

It seemed it all began with a dream. It felt as real as reality itself: ""You will come face to face with an ugly, scaly beast which attacks you when you are half asleep."" When he woke up it took him several seconds before realising he wasn't dreaming. He stared at the monstrous creature in front of him, its eyes yellowed with rage and a red tinge emanating from around its jagged mouth. The beast screamed at him, his name in a terrifying voice, but what would follow scared him most: he didn't understand the sound until it stopped echoing from the ears of the creature. The same thing happened again two weeks later: while sleeping he dreamt of a white animal... He opened his eyes to see an eagle staring down at him with dark bloodred glowing eyes. He didn't need much time to realise this one too wasn't a dream. However he learned that if you try to speak or make any attempt at attacking it will disappear! After about a month he had tried running, falling into rivers etc; anything possible to avoid it. This kept happening until they finally made contact. They caught him in their trap, his legs twitching, his arm hanging limply as they dragged him towards the cave. He looked up at them with tired eyes, trying to decipher everything he heard - ""... Werewolf...."", ""..He won't be joining us anymore..."", ""... We have waited for him..."".

A long sigh echoed through the halls of the hospital as someone shuffled to look over at my body again. They were going for another check up or something like that. I don't remember if the nurse even looked when she left me lying in bed though, and the doctor was still stuck staring at me out of the corner of his eye too. Every few hours she came back to make sure I was alive. As usual. But now it had been almost an hour since he last took a peek from around the corner. No need to worry for him I guess. A couple days ago I realized I was doing more dying than anything else anyway and didn't really have anything left to worry about. Besides, what would happen if I stayed here longer? There are worse places than this sterile white room to die right? Though, there is no other way for me to think anymore really. Not without dying first, anyways. Maybe one day I will run into a wall but probably not before then. 

""No sign of life. Oh good, finally found him awake..."" The physician muttered as he approached me once again. He checked my pulse and smiled wryly. ""...well isn't this great. One hundred percent heart rate but breathing sounds pretty bad. You know we can put a tube down your throat to help you breath easier, wouldn't want us to lose you right now."" The doc leaned against the wall next to me, looking over my sheet with obvious curiosity.

I could feel myself getting tired, feeling the blood drain away from my face. It wasn't happening so slowly for me this time though, instead it was quick, painful and all together unpleasant. My mind went hazy, and I started seeing things... visions actually, images flash by behind my eyelids in kaleidoscopic colors. Each one different, yet seemingly familiar, and most of them scary. In all honesty, it's been weeks since I became a patient in that medical facility and I can see the same thing every second. Something tells me these visions may be a warning. For the nth time today, however, I couldn't quite place what I saw or how. 


This one image made itself clear: **I see a city.** It is small; maybe only half the size of my country. Only one block wide and two blocks high, built onto an island in the middle of the sea. Its inhabitants are tiny compared to humans. Like ants. Some of them walk around on their hands and some stand upright with legs of straw that barely reach knee height. Most carry weapons, the size of spears or swords, along with pouches containing blades of bone and feathers which gleam brightly underneath the dim lighting. These people are walking in ranks outside of their homes.  Something tells me it isn't friendly. 

One particular soldier stops on the curb in front of a house. His arm extends forward, hand pointed straight above his head. At shoulder level appears the giant human skull from earlier, only this time its teeth are missing and it has both ears. This skeleton holds a sword across its chest and its empty sockets gaze into the soldiers eyes, as if studying him with intent. Then suddenly a man walks over, clad in green fur and carrying something. I recognize those furry things, my hair! All thanks to the faint smell emanating from the man in the furs clothing. They are animals I saw countless times inside my dreams but never managed to capture a picture of. An instant later, they charge from the side towards our eyes. Screams erupt, dust fills the air, and the soldier looks like a deer caught in headlights while watching me fade.

","Death wasn't so bad in the end. At least it wasn't this time around.

She had been running for what seemed like an eternity; she couldn't be sure how much time had passed. A sudden screech of metal on metal caused her to turn and see three more vehicles approaching with headlights blaring wildly at their faces as they drove recklessly at full speed in front of them. Their only option was to duck for cover or get hit, one way or another. She quickly dove behind a concrete barrier off of a sidewalk street corner.

This is why it seemed like she ran for days, weeks, months: because none of them knew when the highway exit for her town would come along and even if it came up soon, she wasn't certain whether it would lead her somewhere safer, happier, etc. Each trip ended the same-- death from an avoidable accident, which surprised the hell out of me in that no longer did I panic and try to run away as usual. Instead, when I finally stood tall enough that my hands weren't shaking, I started crying. Sometimes crying helps process feelings in an emotional catharsis, so I guess that worked better than I expected. In fact, instead of starting to cry at first sight of death again, I actually laughed once I saw my face reflected in someone else's puddle of blood. It made me feel less alone and perhaps helped to ease some of the fear. Maybe laughing was also what finally broke me free from whatever prison death had confined me to because the only thing I remember after is seeing nothing but white walls, though eventually I began to hear soft voices talking to me.

At first it felt like nothing, just words and sounds with no purpose. They talked mostly about stuff people do, going to work, eating food, hanging out with friends, watching television, shopping for groceries, sleeping with others... Things are happening all around us, these conversations implied. And then there was something else too, things I didn't know such as what is 'death', 'rebirth', 'life', or any other concept that describes life as we have traditionally understood it before. The doctors and nurses were baffled by the man that suddenly began speaking of his supposed 'previous life'. They told him he should talk to a therapist about it, however, despite not knowing who I was, I found comfort being able to talk about myself freely to my new peers, while they tried desperately to make sense of every word out of him despite his odd behavior. To my surprise, it became easier and easier to speak. When he began reading a newspaper, my old roommate said ""he's really good with stories."" But nobody ever asked him to write down the contents nor anything of a similar nature, most often asking him just to tell them more about himself. The truth was that whenever I opened up the doors inside my mind, they welcomed me eagerly. Despite wanting some privacy sometimes, I wanted to say everything I could possibly say, and these interactions allowed me to do just that. One day I stopped, feeling guilty about spending all our time together over meaningless gossip. My roommates told me not to worry too much as long as it kept both of us happy. And well, I thought it did. I missed having real human interaction after spending most of the year alone, so the next person I spoke with I shared my anxieties with, even bragging about doing great in school, receiving an invitation to participate in a debate contest the next week, and how excited I was to see him eat ice cream with me that night. He replied warmly and I felt like I finally truly connected with someone else outside of family relations, albeit just a temporary one. Time moved differently here compared to Earth; I spent weeks meeting each person I interacted with just as much in a hospital bed, always getting invited back, re-introduced, and given the gift of a brief conversation before being shuttled elsewhere, yet every so often I was never met, causing me to sit and wait until eventually, they abandoned me and left to never return. Some days I cried myself to sleep due to loneliness, unable to stand this constant ebb and flow, while others brought me smiles when visiting with those who loved me most. Other times when I woke up confused but happy for what I received yesterday when everyone came to visit. Whatever the reason, they always came. Eventually I met them more as friends rather than strangers and slowly learned what was what, even though I still can't completely place our shared experiences. Every step forward seemed small when all I ever sought was help, but I think progress is better measured by growth than perfection. 

And so I decided against fighting anymore when the doctor said I don't need to live anymore and my heart slowed down as death began to call. This time there will be no escaping, I am assured. For I seem to have fallen asleep, dreaming again. Though this dream was weird because it had become impossible to breathe even while sleeping. The last image I see was of her, smiling gently at me before fading away and pulling up two large blocks with huge red numbers on them.

","I awoke to the faint glow of a cell phone screen illuminating my face and the smell of burnt rubber. I saw it flash to life as I stared at it in confusion before slowly bringing it close to my eyes.

*5:32 AM*


The name on the screen stared back at me with a smirk that made both chills and goosebumps travel up my arms. I'd never seen this number before. Who was this? And why were they calling me so early? No calls like this had ever shown up on any previous occasions after death. Usually, everything faded out after a few seconds of seeing the same numbers come up repeatedly until it started happening again with another day. It's not every day that someone gets their first call from death after they die in one of their alternate universes. Though there are still more than a hundred I haven't been notified about yet. 

It would be nice if it was actually personal, though. At least then I could understand what was going on and how this number came up for me today specifically, if they even knew who they were talking to because most people never remember anything about these things. If nothing else, I suppose they could at least explain *who* sent them. Of course, knowing they had done such an amazing feat of programming could have gone far too far. There were no way all of those phones were preemptively set up, nor were we programmed by some supercomputer or intelligence long dead. There had to be a reason beyond that to make sure a dying person wouldn't be able to access a new account under the number they have currently, or to keep trying various other numbers on their own without noticing, but none ever showed up except this one. Even if they did send the message from a friend's account, maybe they weren't even aware. All sorts of possibilities ran through my head, but the only thing that stopped them before they could form any kind of real conclusions is when I looked away again.

With something strange that happened right beside me, my stomach dropped towards the ground once my eyes found their usual position and turned toward the door. From the corner of my eye, I saw a flicker and movement, and my body moved almost automatically over to cover my left hand and the rest of me as I tried to see what exactly it was making its way toward. My vision finally adapted to the shadowy figure moving slowly towards me in the dim light coming through the window opposite of me. The red outline from the edges of the curtain catching its frame in the dark blue moonlight outside.

There were two hands that walked down the wall toward my bed and pointed directly toward it like an invisible arrow. I pressed my back against the headboard and put my knees up to the side of me to try to get a better view. That's when a shadow leaped from beneath my covers, landing square on top of me to try and take off running toward the door on the other side. Before I realized what it was, it tripped over my left foot, sending it flying toward me and knocking me backwards.

Right after it collided with my leg however, another arm shot forward, grabbing it and turning it upside down and swinging it like a bat. A loud crack of bone followed its thudding impact against the floor. Something screamed loudly behind us as it hit the ground, shaking our beds. That was a very clear sign someone had jumped from above me, striking directly where the noise came from. With an angry shriek escaping the woman that had woken from her sleep, she swung around to give chase. Her silhouette flickered as it dashed towards the bedroom door as ours grew larger in my direction. As darkness seeped away from my vision, I fell into an eternal state of blissful sleep as the world continued spinning faster and faster.

At last, it didn't matter anymore.



And here I am.

","I’m going to call the first “real” death when I fall through space from 10 meters above the ground, unconscious and not moving. It will be the end of my first attempt at self-defense training.

My body is too frail. Every other time before that it would have been an accident like that or another silly mistake on my part resulting in me ending up injured, always minor though, as it turns out I've never actually dieted in this alternate world I inhabit.

Today I fell from so high and landed with such force I felt the impact for days before blacking out. Today was only the first day I felt the pain, yesterday it had gone all the way back up to my heart - right after I saw it: a large man with dark skin, tall with short dreadlocks sticking up straight, muscular muscles glistening under his shorts. He seemed to smile when he noticed me as the rest watched, arms folded across his chest. 

“Looks like you made one fatal error.” His voice sounded low and commanding and despite being shocked, disoriented and bleeding heavily enough I still remember what he said clearly. “Now you should take your leave.”

I don’t know why but he stayed by our side until we were both recovered and free of danger. Apparently he was trying to help us because when I woke up in a makeshift hospital room again, the doctors told me they couldn’t find any cause for my injuries other than the fall. The last thing I remember was being conscious while watching him slip away through another doorway, wondering if he was coming back.

","""The hero finally stood upon a hilltop, overlooking his defeated enemy.""

The heroes sword seemed impossibly out of place against the backdrop of mountains ranging from snowy peaks to volcanic craters to ice-capped glaciers. Each one was bigger than any building I had ever seen, though that wasn't really surprising since it was only 1am where I was standing, still awake from a late night battle I must have won in my dreams.

My brain decided I needed another 2 seconds for victory over this guy but as soon as those few seconds past, he started shooting fire at me. A single arrow struck my back, leaving little scratches along with no sign of pain. My skin healed instantly so I shrugged, ""How annoying,"" I muttered. In a blink of an eye two more arrows flew into my chest, again quickly fading away when they found their mark. This happened over and over until I could barely make a full sentence without dodging a projectile or another. Eventually, after a brief moment where I was unable to move or speak, death came. The darkness pulled me, sucking me inward, whispering secrets to keep me here. It sounded peaceful however. But then I awoke in hell. 

I immediately realized why. If there was a king and a queen sitting on some throne then it wouldn't be me! Instead, two girls were fighting desperately against each other on some sand covered table as the wind whooshed through the trees. Where once snow peaked mountains are now tall blonde women's hair. Snow turned them red due to the fire raining down upon them from above. Once they fought their way up a sheer mountain, the wind carried it to my neck which sent shivers down my spine.  

Suddenly she fell from her throne and layed lifeless on the ground. Beside her on the floor I saw him...my creator, the author. He writhed beneath them both, eyes wide in shock. What is going to happen to him? Will I kill him too or did i wake the villain before the main antagonist?

For millennia and millennia, humans and elves co-existed together in harmony between these nations that spanned across the land. There came a time when all that changed when a war ravaged your village, which ended in utter destruction on both sides. While not every nation lost its people (except you) none survived in the same capacity. Your homeland was abandoned to rot and decay while others became islands of sorts. For centuries humanity went through hardships, such as finding resources, battling monsters, conquering enemies, and everything else you thought existed before the conflict began. With each passing generation, the line blurred between man and elf. Many even embraced their true potential, becoming monstrous beings that terrorized our kind, forcing us to flee further and further inland for safety. As the old battles faded from the collective memories of mankind, the legends of the old gods became nothing more than tales told around fireplaces to children. The god of strength grew weaker and weak to the point where he simply stopped resisting the tide of evil in human society and vanished. Thus, humankind found a new ruler: a dark being called 'the shadow lord'. This is a tale yet to end.


There comes a time in life when men learn of the consequences of their actions. In those last moments spent atop your ruined home your thoughts travel back in the minds of people alive today, seeing each person that lives in each town and city, each of whom suffered from the bloodlust caused by the invasion that devastated your world. Some mourn the loss of loved ones, some celebrate the freedom to leave the land behind. Few actually look back and think about how everyone died in the end.

","""You have won the game of D&D.""

My character blinked at me from atop his throne, dead in my hand. 
I'd slain him after nearly three dozen attempts; he wasn't quite as strong as I thought. But there it was - victory was mine! A moment later, however, all had returned back to its former state with a bang of thunder that shook the entire castle grounds. The wizard standing next to me looked on in awe before running out, fleeing in terror. ""Run,"" I heard someone yell behind me, which is exactly what he did. My feet kept moving forward, but they seemed too heavy; time itself felt like it was slowing down. Or maybe my reaction time was simply decreasing...? Then the world snapped into focus and it hit me - something hadn't been as set as it should be, or didn't exist as much as it should have for it to not run away upon seeing blood. 

For the briefest of moments I watched my antagonist struggle on his knees. No! His face contorted into pure despair. He wanted to talk. I listened attentively, watching him say words that made no sense. It had happened countless times over the course of centuries as characters in D&D died off: the dying voice would rant about the impending doom to come while he waited for his inevitable end, though nobody really paid attention to them. In this case, however, I noticed he was speaking in a language unknown to anyone else except me. Despite knowing so little of it, I could understand every single word spoken, despite them not belonging to human tongues. The fearlessness of his death-throbbing speech spoke volumes, and I couldn't bring myself to kill him once more, let alone leave him alive only to see his death repeat again in a few paragraphs.

The first attempt had failed, both of us were still breathing as he fell and I knew instinctively to avoid killing him immediately. As he struggled for breath, I took another look around and saw how I was holding a sword; I raised it to my mouth cautiously, looking to his right, to ensure that he wouldn't come at me with his staff, but alas, he was lifeless - all that remained of him was his crown lying discarded on the ground beside the throne chair he stood upon. Another successful attempt. 

At the same time, there were voices calling my name. All of them sounded alike to one another: innocent children calling for me to help, or perhaps play with them. They would stop asking sooner rather than later once their parents came along, but my mind didn't process them as such at the time, instead focusing on the sounds of the castle grounds slowly filling up with screams and shouts of confusion, anger, and frustration. It felt like an eternity before these calls stopped; then the sounds began anew, this time they were filled with joy, elation, celebration, glee, hope, peace, love, mercy, forgiveness... And finally my own name: a symphony of delight accompanied me through my childhood, where none dared speak against me until adulthood, yet even then most stayed silent when they talked amongst themselves.

And finally everyone understood. My father stepped forward and embraced me with an unfathomably tight hug. After some time we pulled back, and he stroked my hair. He held onto me longer than necessary. 

Then everything changed.

He watched as his character took note of this and looked for an easier way around. Just before he could find anything the forest guard appeared again.   He quickly stepped back on cue. A woman appeared at the end of the screen and said, ""I am so sorry. My wife came over while I was looking something up and got confused. Don't worry though! She can make new ones."" The husband nodded awkwardly in return. The camera panned away once more.

The man sighed as he handed over his new necklace back to the old shop keeper. The antique jewellery store had opened on every corner in this town since the turn of the century, but they all remained popular due to their incredible pieces of art, even better than any other local antique store. Unfortunately for the man whose family owned it, he was no longer the jeweller selling them.

He stepped back out into the cold dark streets and down into the sewer system without hesitation; he always hated being forced back outside by shopkeepers who kept demanding explanations for his presence, so many times they tried getting rid of him that finally one managed to do exactly that. If he didn't leave by then there wouldn't be another reason to stay. He wished one day he could afford something like those pendants from the jewellers window, but he just couldn't bring himself to ask anyone anymore after how many times he got stuck here and almost froze to death. They'd get away laughing when the police told them it was really some guy who wore heavy clothes because they had no idea what to wear underneath the thick coats, while they also wondered what sort of homeless person would try to rob their store. That was precisely what his family tried to convince themselves, yet he knew better. And so he wandered again until he found a place to lay and die.


It happened a few moments later: a light, an incredibly bright light. In a moment of panic he dropped the necklace into the dark, covered up once more with water. He thought of his wife and kids, his beautiful children that were growing bigger and brighter by each passing hour, but the world around him turned white. Then black, then blue, then nothing at all. Nothing existed besides the sound of rain and thunder rolling through his brain, nothing else.

He just nodded back quietly, so naturally we both knew each other well enough that there was nothing more to be said except for thanking him for his business. He was always quick to come when he noticed another thing in my window or in one of the shops next door that was too good for anyone else but myself.  

He came and sat beside the coffee table where he had done so many times before as we settled into our chairs near the window looking at my shop as I started placing the plates onto the counter one by one in between sips of my drink until they were all placed there. We watched customers walk past from behind the glass pane watching their faces and reactions as I talked about something boring without actually speaking.  Once the last plate was place upon the counter the two people standing in line went out of the shop. 

The man reached for a jar off of the counter that stood next to a box he was already grabbing in anticipation. As he did this another hand shot up, grabbing his arm instead, stopping him. A sigh escaped his lips along with a small grin ""Oh hey Sam"" she says. 

I chuckled ""You are still doing deliveries for me."" I asked looking back towards where the girl was standing. The same one who waited here every day and smiled in exchange for her free tea if she wanted anything in particular would stay to talk after serving others, but no one told the man that apparently some humans needed less social engagement than others. She nodded her head and held up two coins to pay for the coffee and tea she had taken from the cup as they sat on her knee again ready to grab the rest for themselves as soon as I served them. 

""So sorry, Sam. This looks like my favorite! It was getting cold waiting for you. Can I get it tomorrow?"" 

Sam looked away nervously from the woman across from him as he mumbled ""Yep!"" In an undertone while I set the plates aside as I continued refilling mugs. They exchanged nods of agreement which made little sense. 

After seeing only my hands and having her purse fall open several times to grab coins and bills to pay quickly Sam stood up and grabbed my attention. ""One of these things is going to happen,"" she said with her eyes fixed on the empty seat in the chair behind me. ""They may not want to wait for the delivery right away so we will need something for those days too."" Sam turned around then gave us her best smile ""Don't worry either way!""

If there hadn’t been so many coins laying on the floor near the exit, I would have thought he had left them in my shop when he had come to buy them. 

Once again, I returned the coins. “Here is a total of... ”I counted the coins once before returning them to him. They were indeed an odd amount to count while not speaking, even for someone who never wanted to talk to begin with. The shopkeeper was used to his shyness and his habit. The few times he had spoken over the years, we knew exactly how to keep everything simple and quiet, especially under these circumstances. One of his friends had been here just last week, trying to haggle on some shoes. Another time, I had run into him at a party - which has become quite common to see new people around here, considering how cheap our little corner has gotten these days. People will literally steal whatever they can get their hands on, but you know what? I had always suspected that his thieving went beyond mere survival. Sometimes, I got the impression it was a curse. Maybe that’s why he couldn’t do it himself - no matter how difficult something may look, sometimes your body can’t take it. For most people who want to steal from me, it comes down to money in the end. Perhaps that is the reason why he doesn’t leave any goods behind, the thief just came by today to try some luck in order to fulfill a wish for money since he seems not to have anything better to live from other than stealing. “Thank you!” I hear him shout and drop the coins back onto the counter.  In my experience as a shopkeeper, when someone says ""thank you"" to me while still talking quietly behind the counter, I immediately know it isn’t anything too great. Most customers don’t notice the quietness after he exits, nor does the fact they took their items quietly. Only the ones that are usually caught red-handed. These were different kind of customers; those whose wishes aren’t granted. That leaves me thinking it wasn’t really gratitude. It was probably because I saved his life once upon a time ago.

Make sure to have dialogue and include *subtly* why the thief stole. Don't say it, make it implicit.","The old woman ran her fingers across the top of the display case that held nothing more than glass and wood. ""It appears you have returned,"" she said softly, glancing at me as I picked up another piece of coal.

I smiled meekly. A single spark lit beneath my eye but she didn't notice nor did she care. She was not the cruel owner, though she could tell anyone from miles around when they were dishonest. As many people had done in the past week, I found myself returning after purchasing an item and seeing if I may take something else off her shelf. The items were on sale so I figured there would be a plethora of items available today.

As usual, I came empty handed. No coal this time, however. My pockets felt cold against my thin coat. That reminded me as well as reminding herself; I hadn't brought any coins today. 

""Why don't you simply stop by tomorrow then? You seem like a fellow who really likes what we sell,"" She noted gently. Though her voice was soothing, I still couldn't help but tremble slightly at her words. If all I wanted was coal, just buy coal. How often do shopkeepers go out of their way for every customer? Not often, I surmised, yet here I sat. Perhaps the same happened to her too, or maybe she noticed it first before I did. Then again how could she possibly know what I looked like? And even if she did wouldn't she call the police if I tried to trick her somehow. After all how can one convince someone to stay away if only they knew that they were stealing from them?

The older woman placed an ornate book beside the other two items, which also seemed odd but at least it wasn't anything threatening... perhaps a sword or something. Though if I had to guess, either way, that was an awful lot of metal. I sighed internally. All right fine, okay, I don't know why I am doing this anymore. Whatever does she want now...?

""Here, you don't seem like you need much money."" Her hands trembled a little bit under mine, though no doubt that was because I put the books down in front of her instead of back onto the shelf that she gestured to earlier.

I stared curiously at the objects, attempting to read the names inscribed on them, but I found myself struggling greatly. It seems I should return with actual currency so they won't think I am some sort of idiot. What kind of shopkeep goes into debt buying books for others? Oh wait nevermind, they clearly are worthless to me as well. I will pay the price after all, regardless of its contents. Or rather, I will pay the exchange rate of the object I trade the equivalent of. Even if they aren't worth a cent to me personally, I could always pawn them off somewhere else. There must be plenty places looking for treasures in whatever state the owners keep them...

And thus the night passed. When her own eyes glazed over the objects in my hands I turned, grabbed the key chain hanging from my purse, unhooked my bag from my shoulder, and stepped aside. I made a few small apologies while leaving my bag lying about the counter behind him. I had earned enough experience to use such tricks quite successfully once long ago, and frankly I had gotten lost in thought. Besides tonight, my wallet was empty and my stomach was growling like hell itself. I left, wondering if I saw her reaction correctly. Did she look surprised to see me disappear? I wondered if she had expected me to leave, considering everything I had been talking about. But whatever it may be she didn't say anything, and no one has ever called me a poor sod, unless they've met my father. He loved his penny-pinchers and used me as a target for practice for years whenever he taught me self defense. So I did what any respectable human being would do; I walked away quickly. The alleyway had an interesting atmosphere, and it was warm enough that it wasn't particularly unpleasant being alone outside. I pulled open my jacket, hung up my bag upon the wall, and locked the door from where I stood.

Finally satisfied, I started to walk home. On the way, I passed by numerous familiar faces and heard many greetings. The day went by rather pleasantly until I came home early evening.

They are like the vast and timeless gulf, it is an expanse filled with stars I cannot name nor count but only admire for their brilliant radiance against the black canvas. There are no lights in that void, save my own reflection staring back at me, a pale, thin copy of myself. We don't have to speak. What words can even describe or define that which transcends all communication?  

I see a flicker of curiosity at the edges, as if they wish there was more space to fill those infinite reaches within their pupils so I could begin telling them stories of my time on Earth, about its dark moments, and of course, love and sex.  As an immortal I have never been able to experience either. And I wonder how much I will be able to ever explain this mystery to her. 

Then again, maybe she isn't worthy of such intimate knowledge - it wouldn't be fair to burden her. In fact... perhaps she hasn't come far enough to see such depths. Perhaps in another million years, centuries to come her mind might finally reach a place where it understands just why humans become obsessed by such things. Even though it pains me to say so; because for millions upon millions of years my soul has been in darkness unable to find light, hope, love, beauty, meaning beyond the boundaries of this celestial rock where she now dwells. As soon as she learns this language, she must learn one day that you shouldn't take others for granted, you should cherish every moment and kiss given and hold onto each word whispered in your ear like it is gold and keep her close forever because none other than mortality itself holds a power over our fates.

","We'd been together for eight years, but I never knew that one day our conversation would stop being an exchange of words and instead begin to be the source of my sanity.

""Look,"" he said to me in the hospital room, his voice choked with emotion and hope after my diagnosis, ""I love you more than any words could ever articulate.""

At least once every two weeks we had this discussion about our marriage. Every so often he would tell me how much I meant to him, how happy I made him, but every time it seemed as if something was always wrong. He didn't understand. This was not what we had agreed upon.

How long did we have? How much time before life became unbearable? We were married for just under ten years, we'd meet with someone who specialized in marital therapy each month or so. If he kept doing this, then he would eventually kill himself and all I would have left would be memories of happiness.

He was still sitting here with me; this is exactly where he sat during every visit. But today felt different. A smile played on his lips as I watched him; usually, when I told him I didn't want anything to do with him anymore there was nothing beyond an apologetic grin and a hug from the asshole, but today there was a glint of joy in his eyes. What has changed? No idea. Just an odd thought came to me: I wished I had that little spark in my eyes when I look at him; maybe he wouldn't hate me enough yet to kill himself again.

No comment. I looked away. All of the patients are lying here talking about their husbands. None of them can afford better treatment. That doesn't change the fact that they can't survive without them. Me neither. My husband wasn't the only good looking one out there. Plenty of other beautiful women wanted his attention. I should make friends with some and tell them to call me too. Maybe I won't even need the pill to sleep. Maybe tomorrow morning when I wake up, everyone will know we're over.

","There were two of us standing at the center of a square. The only problem was, I had an arrow.

The other one? A pair of sharpened pencils... They're all sharp-pointed and pointed at me, just waiting for their moment to pounce like some kind of ninja assassinations team.

Our teacher hadn't shown any particular sign of awareness about this little war that is occurring in our classroom though. He seemed content as he wrote something on a board and made out instructions for what exactly we should do with the sharpeners later on...

I tried to look busy trying to work my way around a particularly difficult triangle but it wasn't going quite as well as I thought it would. My brow furrowed while struggling and groaning as if I actually had some sort of headache. The sound stopped when two sharp points crossed my arms; ""you can't hide your hand behind your arm!"" the voice shrieked. But alas they weren't really there. Two lines of graphite stood where those words said they were supposed to be but no hand.

As the class moved out of the line and into individual desks, the pencil came right at my elbow before stopping dead on its point next to the eraser section. 

""You're lucky that you have your own tools! Some people have not been so lucky."" The first attack came from inside my desk. 

It continued relentlessly: three more hits came straight at my face. This wasn't the best time for art but I figured I'd try since everyone else would probably forget soon enough and stop attacking now that I'm stuck sitting here. 

They got closer and closer until I saw nothing left for them but my heart. At the last second though, I took a deep breath and pushed myself up off my chair, tripping over the foot rest once before landing right between the two weapons aimed at me. The tips hit each other instead of me after my fall which meant both of mine could land on top of me, too. All five fell into one pile, broken and useless yet still able to hit each other and my head and everything else except my head which didn't even move at the impact of the falling bullets.

We turned back around slowly to face our teacher again who was now smiling down upon us, watching how the fight played out. Well okay then...

I hate pencils though. There is no excuse for how much I like pen. I don't even know why they make me so sad all the time it's just there are so many things I can write with pens

There was so many possibilities. They are also cheap and easy to find, I don't have to worry if i lose them either! So i decided to get ready as soon as I got back home

The first time I did this i drew an extremely good butterfly however it did not take long before she began to notice me working quietly after all she would come downstairs every now and then looking into my bedroom but never entered into it since her husband always stopped by whenever there was any noise coming from upstairs

But there was nothing in the world besides that damn pencil that I loved more than my father or mother

And this one seemed more special than usual

It has been 15 years since we moved into this apartment building, in which our whole family has lived for years. In that time we lived two floors above this block with another family that still lived here

But they moved recently due to some new opportunities that father found in Germany

And because we couldn't leave without packing almost everything of mine since its birthday day tomorrow it felt pretty nice to finally open up to see the gifts under the Christmas tree once again


So far all i drew was just charcoal and when i saw the gift opened my heart leaped up

","As I walked to my locker for sixth period, there was an urgent feeling in my heart. The first bell of the day just rung and only me and Mr. Smith were left in the hallway.

“You’re going down!” shouted Billy as he charged at me. With quick reflexes I grabbed his paper sword before it hit me. “How is this fair?!” he yelled.

This was always our ritual. At the beginning of school we would pick up anything we can find out here to start off with; whatever that may be. It could even have been one of my pencils or something like paper. We fought using them against each other.

But that wasn’t all. When the two had become friends, they started taking their weapons inside class everyday after lunch. They would use their weapons on people who seemed suspicious or didn’t look happy at school. Sometimes when someone would say something mean about him Billy had gotten mad enough to fight another guy. As much as everyone loved to hear what they said because every word sounded so realistic, no one would ever bring either of them into any kind of trouble unless they wanted to fight. If you saw someone who was being beaten up you had a choice to do good or evil. Some might punch the guy or girl getting beaten and save them, while others would sit back watching and enjoy. That’s how Billy and me ended up. 

“This isn’t going anywhere, stop,” yelled David as he looked in front of me. 

It was time for Billy to get bullied again. A new boy came to our school last month from London and got thrown right in at the deep end. All the students know that he is not a native English speaker which made him stand out among his classmates. He has been kicked out of classes, made fun of constantly and kept on the receiving end of many bullies. 

“I am not fighting you…” said Billy. Looking really disappointed both stared into eachothers eyes. After five minutes they suddenly broke apart. But a lot has changed since then. 

It is interesting how quickly our childhoods disappear and how fast we change until they come back in our minds when things went wrong. My life is very stressful because of those memories but nobody else knows. Just Billy and me...

","The room was alive with the thrumming energy of thousands of angry voices. It flowed along the floor, like a river and then, as if its banks had been breached, it erupted around me like flames from a nuclear bomb.

The first attack came in a blur, just at the edge of vision, not quite fast enough to be tracked with the naked eye. Like bullets out of a .50 caliber automatic weapon and my eyes only registered about half of the hits, due to their movement through my pupils. My head hurt, but I couldn't let myself feel anything other than terror and fury.

Next time, one hit by a large stick, another by an orange crayon tip. The pain was unbearable but the fear that I knew was coming kept me calm. Just then the world went black, as though someone had covered my eyes behind my eyelids; the scent of burnt paper invaded the air.

My eyes snapped open and I realized that everything was moving rapidly past me at an unreal speed, the world a blur of color and noise. A pencil plunged into the side of the head, followed by several others. And, for one last time, I cried. For once I wished I was dead, wishing I would simply shut down all functions so no damage could ever happen again. There came a moment where I thought I would die right there in the doorway, never to exist again. But after a few seconds I felt a sharp jolt and the world turned back to the normal slow pace we were used to having our memories recalled with each flash of memory.

","The ship was destroyed moments ago, but as soon as I made my way back through the space wormhole to return to my homeworld and begin the long voyage back from there with the other survivors, everything disappeared... except for him.

We left Earth over a century before the destruction of the Star Gate that we now know is responsible for our recent exodus across the universe. Our journey lasted close to three years, only arriving on Xylos after 18 months when this mysterious hole suddenly appeared in space nearby us while traversing the Milky Way galaxy. On the bridge, everyone waited anxiously for news of their impending crash landing. It was supposed to arrive within seconds upon opening up its gates for us to enter into, yet there was no indication when or even where in the depths of space it would appear. We were so busy preparing for any eventuality, that no one noticed when it had already opened up. Suddenly we went silent as something fell out of space at incredible speeds. At first the crew panicked as they scrambled to prepare for impact, but they soon realised this wasn't a meteorite or asteroid from afar, but more like an object flying at subluminal speed, which no matter how hard you tried to calculate, can only exist given time travel was possible, but there are just not enough equations or explanations to make sense of this anomaly. No sooner did these thoughts cross everyone's minds before all hell breaks loose. In a split second we were plunged into darkness and knocked clean out until some of us began waking up in the hospital and found ourselves greeted by this man. When we attempted to contact anyone, or even explain that none of what he was telling us could possibly be true, we found our attempts futile, though most assumed it simply stemmed from shock, disorientation, or fear of the unknown, especially if our crew had survived the initial crash. As our ships started getting closer to shore, more than a hundred miles away, things took a turn for the worse. The only thing they brought was an army, or maybe a thousand or two, or a group much larger because each person got shot right before their bodies touched the ground. By this point, either they died in battle, surrendered or they joined in and took up arms along with the few remaining defenders still alive. To put it simply, none of those who knew anything of what actually happened escaped alive. And me? Well here I am standing next to that very same man, ready to face whatever will come next

""He's done it!""  A cheer erupted. This man stood tall amongst the gathered crowd, having slain the greatest enemy mankind has ever faced. Yet amidst the celebration, I felt cold dread fill my heart. From the edge of the crowd, someone yelled ""Bring the man down."" But my feet weren't moving. A shiver spread through my body like the winter wind cutting through December snowstorms. Then it hit me - that voice belonged to the great hero... and a terrifying figure standing behind him. They both ran towards me, dragging me out of the circle of people surrounding them. With both hands cuffed behind my back, I turned back to watch the crowds leave me, my own friends and allies gone and replaced by strangers who looked too sharp and pointed. Behind me came the familiar roar of the engine of the spaceship that crashed into our town about a hundred yards from where I was bound to stand. I cried out as my bonds ripped loose, and then watched helplessly as the door was shut once again and flew off into the air, leaving me alone to wonder whether this city would survive. Then, the doors sealed themselves shut in my place.


A loud *thunk* followed, then silence settled in, broken only by the gentle ticking of the clock I somehow forgot to tell them about to begin fixing my suit. Looking out at the starry sky above me I heard the words spoken by another one of my comrades, ""It's your fault, mate! Now go get help."" I said nothing. Time passed slowly around me; moments later the timer reached zero, the room swung open with the heavy weight that always accompanies a closed door and a lone figure, covered in blood ran up to me, grabbed me by the arm and threw me into the open spacecraft. I landed heavily onto the metal floor and managed to catch myself from rolling over due to the sudden movement, and then as quickly as I stopped the nausea kicked in, throwing me to the floor in a convulsion of pain and blackouts. Upon regaining consciousness, I was strapped to my seat and told how much better it felt outside. A good amount of hours passed before it became clear that it was actually several days. After finally waking up fully, I asked the scientist in charge of the treatment: what kind of cure was being conducted in this chamber? He didn't answer for several minutes as the doctor came rushing to my rescue, then replied in a condescending tone ""Oh, Mr Johnson,"" he said, ""I believe there's been a misunderstanding, I meant to say 'cure-all'. Which means that there's no cure-all"". My head spun round and round again, confusion overtaking me. All I could think of was the sound of crying. That cry sent chills down my spine. Then I remembered - all the scientists had cried as well. Some of them had also smiled and thanked me. Most of them hadn't though, instead, they were waiting patiently in line to find their own cures.

It had rained for six hours now that was one reason why we couldn't work for so long. We were all huddled up in the main building because the only other power grid was 20 kilometers away from us; not to mention some crazy storm raging down south.

He had left the island twenty years ago and returned last month. Since then, life hadn't changed much. His apartment rent hadn't increased, crime wasn't any worse than when he moved out, and even the weather seemed unchanged save for that annoying fog that seemed to appear more often. But it was all very nostalgic - the one thing that made him stay here.  One wouldn't expect an 18 year old to have stayed in the same place for two decades except to meet friends like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, yet there they were: both still living on their own in identical homes ten miles north of the city centre. A few other people also lived here but nobody really knew their name, nor where they came from.

Bill said ""What took you so long!"" while turning around and seeing his friend. It looked about the same as he remembered it, but with less dust and rust on the windows and doorframe.  ""Don't tell me, did you finally come over this week?""

""I am afraid not"", responded John laughing.  ""I live six miles from your place and haven't seen you yet! We may have different schedules though.""  

John was shocked by the response. ""I work two jobs,"" retorted Bill, making fun of his friend.  ""If that weren't enough, I try hard to have social activities during the day to avoid being bored."" 

The couple stopped talking after that as they started to slowly move towards each other, hugging their old pal once again. The night went on until past midnight when the three had fallen asleep, probably wondering where the heck they ended up on this little island off the coast of Japan.

I was sitting opposite him at one of those plastic examination chairs with the round base. My head bobbed slightly. I had learned that nodding meant yes, so my eyes were not only bobbing but looking around confusedly.

""Your mother..."" He began before stopping short. I shot up from my chair and ran to the window where Mrs Smith stood, watching our interview like she knew exactly what it was about

""She just started to scream,"" My voice seemed different now, almost human, though I couldn't quite understand why

A long sigh emanated from the doctor as he walked back to sit at his desk. As if he wasn't completely annoyed with me already because I didn't speak when we were supposed to or nod more actively than usual. It was difficult to explain in words how hard being this way was, to not be able to comprehend simple conversation while trying desperately not to offend anyone would become quickly exhausting. That it took days and times for it to register in me what the doctor said earlier. That after hours on end I was exhausted from communicating all the same

McGreggor chuckled nervously ""Well...your father seems like a fine man, I hear he's going to take care of everything. There shouldn't be much of a problem.""

I nodded again, thanking him silently for comforting words. And then smiled. Thank heavens for smiles! They were harder to act out without speaking normally since they never got put into context properly, the subtle raising of the lips making sense even without the mouth actually saying anything, but then no one could see them when the light dimmed the room was black, which was also confusing. How could everyone look so happy without a bit of sunlight hitting their face? I did miss having that, still, it made communication easier. But really I wanted to run outside without the need to stop first for my mom. She wouldn't understand, anyway. Then again who would. Nobody understands how terrible it is to be locked in a lab without windows where the floor glows blue in the dark. Not all the time, but especially right now I want it brighter. Or I wish it weren't blue when nobody told me to turn off the lights. It hurts more than it should.

My dad hated when anyone interrupted us. Even doctors, it wasn't nice talking to someone with a rubber nose that wouldn't stop clicking against their face as Gregg spoke to our parents. Though there was probably nothing else to say besides thanking them for taking care of things since neither of them liked discussing matters like this. But I did. So I guess you'd understand my relief when Gregg gave me something to talk about.

""No, I don't think so."" Was that how it went? That question usually came next: ""Are you listening?"" Of course I wasn't, it's too loud. Where are all these bright people going to store all these tubes? They must have enough left over for the rest of us, but I hate going for scans and getting poked and prodded. At least we can eat at 3pm without needing any extra spoons, they put those in your lunch bag too. My mother made sure of that. Like clockwork, unless there was a new test they tried recently I don't remember what I thought had changed today

There must have been something different today, I saw her smile when Gregg walked over. A little wider, maybe two degrees less hidden behind a layer of white fabric covering the lower half of her face. I hope it won't fade when she finally learns how to keep track of me without checking my chart

It's hard to say goodbye to Gregg whenever he needs to leave, but it helps that he always makes sure my parents stick around until we say hello and kiss him on both cheeks. He likes doing it for Mrs Smith. Makes her feel better knowing someone else notices her. Well, whoever it is, apparently, I never get a good goodbye from her. The moment her hand reaches past me she walks away, muttering something I pretend I didn't hear like everybody else does, except unlike them I do see things like bloodstains on the wall and a faint pink ring on one of my mothers legs.

As soon as she leaves I start hyperventilating and sob quietly while wiping away tears. No wonder they put me on Xanax sometimes...they don't always know how bad it gets. Especially for me. Especially if something happens after I try to disappear. Luckily most of the tests will have ended, otherwise my sobs may sound even louder. Today was another day filled with red ringing ears, broken bones and broken hearts. Now they make more noise than normal. Maybe that's why Gregg has to come back later tomorrow afternoon anyway. Sometimes he talks to himself, and the way he looks in the mirror I bet it pisses him off. Maybe today he won't find anybody but me in the mirror and stay with him instead.",2.421875,0.2080078125,0.1357421875

[removed]","""A subject may be mentally retarded...""  I stopped writing on my clipboard and looked up at the guard

The man looked at me with weary eyes, ""You know what I'm trying to say, don't you?"" He said

My response had come before my conscious process could fully take control of it; ""But if so do we have any choice?""

There was no answer from the guard. After sitting there for a few moments of agonizing silence I turned back to my paper,""In that case I suggest we try something different."" 

The guard took a moment to consider this: ""You mean? Like, giving him some sort of test?"" He asked looking around nervously while gesturing his hands about the empty room. They were all wearing blindfolds but still couldn't help but feel trapped. We were in here waiting our turn for testing. We only had twenty minutes until they would call one of us out. If he stayed in here long enough he might never see the sun again

The guard gave a short nod and left to go get another person and a sheet of paper:""Go ahead sir..."" He said quietly returning just a minute later.

This time I grabbed a pencil and put down 'Yes' for his first two or three questions then stopped and scribbled frantically on the paper

The guard leaned forward expectantly; ""What was I thinking?"" Was all he said before leaving and quickly returning after a half-minute. A new doctor came into the room with a plastic box and the usual white coat: *another psychopath*

Now *this* guy was far more knowledgeable.

""...so...is your IQ above sixty?"" He asked turning slightly and looking directly at Subject 41 with intense stare. The black rimmed glasses that lay upon the face of the lab rat looked like tiny pin holes that surrounded the wide pupils that stared right through them. You couldn't make eye contact with someone like that because there'd be nothing behind them except blank white pits where eyeballs should have been

After finishing filling out the second question the doctor closed the notebook with the click of a metal clasp and laid it beside the others along with the pen which I'd finished writing with earlier:*this isn't going well,* I thought to myself. And *why not* I added in my own head. This is how things happen...there is no escape. In reality though the only thing I felt sure of was being wrong.*they want this to end.* As my thoughts bounced off of each other I slowly started to think differently

*what are their goals?* I challenged. What did they want me to say? Why didn't my life matter at this point to these people who wanted to experiment on my brain? What was their reason to create me? How many millions of my sisters and brothers are currently living underground under harsh conditions in locked cages waiting for this very day to come. I smiled slowly and looked into the red glass cube holding *his* hand tightly wrapped together as they lead me out past the group I was supposed to be with into what seemed like a corridor filled with men dressed in black coats and blue jeans. There weren't too many men in there - maybe ten *maybe twenty*. But who knows, when you're used to being tested every single week like I am. These labs are always over crowded. It doesn't make sense. Where are the doctors? And why are there guards everywhere?*but I don't care now anyway!* I thought

We arrived at a large office space and I saw a couple guys standing in front of doors labeled with numbers on them. Each door had its assigned number written under it along with the date they went in and the date they came out.*this is my luck*, I muttered, staring at a door marked 8.46*if they really knew the names of all those boys on here they probably wouldn't send him to another lab now, would they?* Now it just gets interesting. No, scratch that. That makes no sense! It wasn't even possible in this day in age. Who does that?! Maybe these people aren't what they pretend they are.*it's okay to think crazy here and there* I told myself, shaking my arms as much as I could. I stood perfectly straight like the other prisoners across the room. Our heads snapped up at that sound and all of us turned towards the entrance at the same time. Some guys were walking in but there was a bigger crowd than expected behind them. I walked out of the group and tried to leave by myself before the big group behind them entered. My footsteps echoed loudly against the floor as I got closer and closer to the exit. At last I reached it and bolted past everyone into the street. Not caring if it was safe or dangerous I ran further away. No thought whatsoever could prevent me from running.*who cares* I screamed to myself.*it's better to run fast and die now than walk slow and die later.* In less than a year, I will finally be freed from these chains! I was breathing hard.*thank you, thank you, thank you...* I thought in between sobs. Just wait until they are done with their experiments on me and my little sister.*she can stay down there and rot!* She deserves worse than what's awaiting her at least as soon as they find out. The doctor has a new patient to evaluate anyways*



(continued)



Just realized I completely forgot to mention what actually happened in the beginning to set the scene. The whole time i ran out of the lab the guards kept shouting things like ""run!"", ""run!"" , ""RUN!!!"" . As I ran as fast as I could I heard their words bounce around in my ears repeating themselves without end. Then I tripped over a small piece of rubble and fell flat on my back. Another roll over on the ground brought a knee into the stomach. But I rose up once again running. I stumbled, caught on a sewer grate and rolled once more but this time all the way onto a street nearby. Cars honking madly flew past my ears while screams echoed behind me. No one dared look for their victim - there was just another escaped mental retard, probably no name or background info. All hope lost.",2.046875,0.2021484375,0.1923828125

At last! You know what's really weird? Even after living alone for so long I still don't think anyone noticed I ran away. My parents are probably at work or school again. They never actually had time to explain how they knew where I was anyways because you know...science. But hey, maybe they won't mind having an heir who takes care of themselves better than them? Maybe they were relieved they stopped giving me medication once I took my first ever shower without a psychiatrist or doctor watching. Yeah that explains a lot. Or not, whatever.

I woke up sitting at my normal breakfast table with nothing around me except food and silverware. No mom and dad staring down at me while I eat. No annoying neighbor across the street with his obnoxious kids yelling every day, playing loud music all hours of the day and night. Nothing, truly, at all. It wasn't a prison cell. Not exactly. I sat up and moved my hands around for some minutes before I figured out the room was mine. Mine completely free of prying eyes.  A great start for a little guy.

I wandered around to find more things to build upon my freedom, then I opened the door. Something told me that's where I needed to go. Stepping out the front door and seeing nothing familiar I decided to stay close to it. There were no cars or bikes and almost no houses here, not anywhere near my previous home. All that stood between myself and the road were trees, all planted densely together. A tree seemed pretty familiar. I walked through the line of wood slowly as if someone was lurking around the corner. My hand stayed pressed against the small handle. Almost got hit by a leaf or something twice. I continued deeper into the woods. 

Then I saw it, or rather, heard it coming down from the air. It came crashing down behind a clump of trees, leaving massive destruction of its surroundings. And people standing above. More trees were thrown. Rocks and logs rained down on the ground below. My breath caught. Those weren't leaves raining down, those were humans. Human bones lay scattered everywhere. There was so much blood. At least one person lay on top of another person covered with blood over it's body, laughing hysterically. My breath got heavy and quickened even faster, causing me to stumble backward to make sure I didn't trip off of some nearby rock. Another laugh from above made me jump, spinning around and holding my knife like a spear. But instead of attacking the new threat above me, I fell unconscious from shock and fear.

**NOTE:** Please do not respond with threats or murder threats as this character is clearly insane.

[removed]","**Name:** Subject 41
**Age:** 7 years old 
**Assigned Psychologist:** Dr. Lector 

""Hello there,"" said the psychologist as he entered the room in which subject was being kept with many others on the floor and several more sitting at desks and computers nearby him. ""We are going to be doing a little interview right now, it doesn't last very long, so don't worry. If you do not answer my questions truthfully, then your parents will come take you back home."" He placed his name tag over the clipboard on the desk and began reading from the paper he had written out beforehand.


""So, uhm, well, what's your favorite color?"" I looked down at my own feet. The man asked another question, but I couldn't find any words anymore, let alone give him a simple answer like 'blue,' or 'red', or even 'green'. My head hung low, hiding my face, I wondered if this man was human, for his voice sounded robotic, almost monotone, with only the sound of laughter at his end. 

He tried again as soon as we finished that part. ""Do you have any siblings?"" His mouth dropped a bit upon hearing the answer. Not that I could understand how he acted. Perhaps he had never seen me before? No matter, either way, I simply shook my head slowly. Nothing else came to mind. How could words form themselves inside this strange shell on top of my lungs? They weren't real, I just made them myself to express something. But they wouldn't form into words no matter what I try. Instead, all words would always become meaningless letters and sounds together with noises. I sat here wondering why my vocal cords didn't work properly and started to cry. At least then he finally stopped talking and walked closer to where I sit, holding out his hand, telling me I should talk. He was probably going to ask me some other question... What if I say nothing? If everything fails does anyone really care about me after all? All these thoughts were running through my head while clutching onto my hands. It became hard to hold, for they weren't flesh any longer. 





The door suddenly flew open, and another doctor opened it, laughing at us both. And somehow, he knew exactly what was wrong. 

Dr. Gorson: Yes, I found it. The problem appears to be quite serious though, can we please hurry this along?! Why did it take this long anyway??

Lector: Well, sorry Dr. Gorson, I am not sure what happened there but I believe all the children who have been examined seem like they are unable to speak. Let's bring this one in front to you right now. This boy must be put up for adoption immediately.

Gorson: Thank god! A new volunteer arrived here today, and the test results look amazing!!! So perfect, oh damn my life is complete!!!




Gorson stood at the entrance as Lector carried away subject 41, shaking his fist in displeasure. That was all that remained of me.


Subject 42, born shortly after, came later. After all this time I still haven't understood how I turned so quickly into someone else; it wasn't normal or fair to be so cruel. 



All I wanted was family, a father and mother to teach me better things.

[removed]","“You look so peaceful”. 

I stood for a moment looking into the face of my lover. They stared back with wide eyes. 

“Do you ever wish things could’ve been different?” I muttered, “It’s so funny when you’re asleep just holding me like this. But all too soon it ends, huh?” 

My hands drifted over their body before falling in front of us. For every second that they didn’t wake up another second passed, that I waited and hoped. The clock on the mantle ticked with quiet accuracy. Every tick an echoing echo reminding me how wrong everything felt now. 

Every day I sat next to their cold corpse, holding their hand; each breath from my mouth creating fog around our intertwined bodies. At least we died together, right? Right...? You’d know better than me. It took far longer for any of us to die then we thought. A few years ago after several false starts. One final attempt and no luck. My wife finally went under in her sleep. That last time wasn’t a death, not really. More an ending.  She woke up and looked into my eyes, confused as hell as well as terrified. 

We spent the following weeks desperately trying to revive her. We found more problems than solutions while doing so. Doctors tried everything to bring her back but eventually had to call in experts who said there wasn’t even a chance. When she finally woke up again, she couldn’t remember me... She seemed scared to speak of me or anything related to us but would smile and laugh. Eventually she remembered nothing other than your name and wanted to go home. After countless rounds of therapy and numerous apologies to myself, my coworkers, friends and family she slowly began to come back to herself... I wouldn’t blame her though if she never recovered.  

She always cried for days after one or the two times we spoke without breaks. Her tears were heavy with memories of what we did... but also some sort of grief. As time went on those moments decreased. When the day arrived where she only cried once, that’s when it hit harder. Our marriage had begun in prison. After we graduated from University, my wife knew what kind of man I was; strong, stoic, yet loyal, dedicated. She was a scholar with brains bigger than both of ours combined. Despite our differences they worked magically well together—until she decided it was best to leave me on accident of course. To leave me there on trial without any answers. She couldn’t help anyone else since they already doubted her sanity. She needed a break. A real one—she wasn’t allowed out until one of us died. While I don’t have a mental illness in fact I think it’s quite obvious I’m not insane but damn that woman was weird and fucked up in ways we couldn’t understand. That made perfect sense though. Someone with such intelligence would quickly figure it out anyway, hence why she ran off! Fucked up bastard that she was. 

To make matters worse, she left without telling me; she just turned tail and walked away—one leg straight up and down then the other... No note, no goodbye kiss, fuck. When people see pictures online, don’t let those trigger you please. There was a reason for them. You can be sad too if they give you closure like that, especially if you haven’t been able to talk to her since and have questions. If she truly loved you, then she shouldn’t have run away. Even now there are plenty of reasons why it may have happened but I still wonder why. Why now? Was she waiting for a specific person? Or maybe a group of people? Where could she be? Should I keep searching? Hell yeah I should, I’m fucking crazy for loving you this much. Though I doubt she’ll return. Don’t tell her this. I’d rather beg here on these forums than reach out. No matter the amount of posts I reply to none will answer my question, none of them understand the sheer volume of pain I feel right now. And yes I do think its mine. Its not logical. If we lived long enough we’d have broken down. But we didn’t. What sucks more is knowing that if someone else came along and messed up something I’d have gone for them. Who knows what else could have been done if I had never left prison; it might actually work. But now I’m stuck with this goddamn box-shaped dead-ass bitch. She must really hate me.

[removed]","For all my life I was a dreamer, with dreams of adventures that took me across continents and galaxies. 

When I found you in the hallway of my elementary school, you were surrounded by your friends who looked down on your small height, skinny frame, awkward walk, and lack of confidence. They laughed at you because you never asked anyone into groups and always stuck around with us loners. We watched as you sat alone and cried, until me and Mark pulled you into our circle because we didn't want you crying there alone.

That night when we huddled together and snuggled close while telling spooky stories, something changed between you two. You seemed happier than I had ever seen before. You would hug me extra hard whenever we left school each day, and would sit next to me if no one else was sitting near us, looking at you longingly.

One year later you stood in front of class holding up a pair of white gloves and smiled so broadly it could make angels weep. You danced with her under the harsh fluorescent lights in the cafeteria, and kissed her for ten minutes before everyone else broke away. We saw each other every day after graduation, going through halls of fancy colleges and jobs to help people who lacked hope. You were happy with her though; she taught you how to be comfortable in your own skin again. When someone said some cruel thing to you or made fun of you, or even just stared strangely at you, the thought ""your friend"" flashes in your mind. In return she used you again by using the fact you were once called ""weird"". She would say things like: ""look at Johnny/Brian/Jeff try not to stare any longer"", then whisper something sweet in you ear. Now as an adult, I still see this girl as a stranger sometimes. Her touch makes me weak, her words stir my soul. It has been years since you stopped coming home for weekend trips from California, but your laughter makes sure I can remember everything from yesterday afternoon. I wait expectantly for that call where you tell me you miss me dearly, that you haven't forgotten me. Every second I have without her feels like an eternity. All I have are these memories...Memories of loving arms reaching out and hugging you goodnight, calling me stupid things I didn't ask for, and giving me a warm embrace on my wedding day. But now all I have is emptiness, with those exact memories driving me insane.

(If the last part doesn't describe true lovelessness and resentment, you probably need more practice writing romance.)

[removed]","""You're still awake,"" I say.

They look up at me with bright eyes that I knew how well loved, knowing too well what they were saying before they even opened their mouths, ""What can I do?"" they reply with their usual calm smile. 

I stare blankly for what feels like hours before saying anything, ""How are you already better than me."" They sigh again and say, ""Because I'm not tired."" It may not have been entirely true, but it felt so true in that moment, looking across the table from my bed where nothing more happened than we slept together all night without incident. My parents had gotten mad at us for sleeping on opposite sides of our bed last week when I woke up and ran back into my room, falling asleep there while my dad sat alone in the living room for the rest of the night, playing video games. At least he didn't fall asleep this time. But maybe if Mom did too, there'd be no need to put up with Dad anymore and then I could go back to happily napping next to mom until she died from a heart attack or cancer. Or even just dying right after I turn 25 and don't want to marry anyone because I've figured out that marriage is evil anyway. The idea hadn't come to me yet when Mom died though, so I guess her death was the perfect test-ground for that theory. Maybe Mom was able to wake early because of how close she was, maybe not. No big deal either way, at least she finally went to sleep peacefully. For now anyway.

Mom would've probably gone on forever, but she seemed to grow restless before she passed away as the family watched her passing. My father never did cry until that night, he cried enough for days in fact, for weeks even. That broke my heart. He stopped crying after a couple months though, and slowly got back to his old self, which wasn't actually human by any stretch of the imagination. So sad, losing my loving Mom. Now he just needs to stop blaming me and get back to smiling! 

But that doesn't happen, instead he turns into this crazy angry guy who can barely control himself and tries to push me out of his life because ""it is only logical"" that nobody else would want someone whose brother caused the demise of his wife, you know? I tried telling him that I wasn't to blame, trying to explain everything rationally, going through every single detail of how it happened, but dad wouldn't listen to me. I tried calling police station over and over again explaining that it wasn't me, but they refused to investigate my claims. They told me it might cause undue hardship to my grieving father, so they dropped my call. Apparently this meant the police officer thought i was lying because otherwise why would I feel the need to call over multiple times and tell everyone? Or why would I keep running to my siblings house and having to deal with an upset sister whenever the news hit the media? Even though both my dad and sister were fully supporting me! This isn't fair! Not at all! When is it going to be fair?  Why does it have to be always like this?! What have I ever done to deserve this?? Why am I cursed? Where should I complain to?

One of which is that nobody does what I want or need me to; so if i don't write things the way I want there will be no one there to read them later on anyway lol. Two: when people ask me to write stories my goal is to make them as good as possible and I can only do that when they give me creative direction so I usually have ideas coming in waves that I need someone who wants to see them so they will see them! Third: The ""how many words"" requirement made it hard to get started because some prompts ended up going beyond what should have been reasonable or else they would end before they even hit half the space needed for a prompt; so just making everyone answer to the exact word count may help stop those from appearing!

A large figure standing with arms crossed and a dark purple cloak as they were always wearing before they lost a arm in a duel to *Superheroes Anonymous* years ago. Their skin was a pale colour almost black from centuries of perpetual darkness and the constant rain of hellfire. This was one of their demons that had come to take vengeance after you went through all three stages of *SWA: A Superhero’s Guide To Accepting Your Inner Demons*.

""Because there is no one who wants me."" He turned around and walked down a street he knew well to find some food. ""I want your goddamn soul but I need it more than my stomach. I am a monster! Not even your pathetic ass can tell what pain this fucking entity inside me feels without letting me out!""

The demon sighed as his shoulders trembled from exhaustion. Every time he decided to go back into him, he did an intense amount of damage in his mental state. His mental health slowly deteriorated as days passed and sometimes weeks. One time he couldn't even look at another person in the face. It took so long for him to actually accept himself and leave behind those suicidal thoughts.

It didn't make him feel much better though because now he has *Superhero Anonymous* staring him in the eyes every day reminding him that he's weak compared to his friends. The only one of them that could tolerate staying away from each other for extended periods of time without dying or killing themselves was Super Man. But let's be honest here if there was anyone able to handle *Superhero Anonymous* aside from Superman than that bastard should of gone full retard when facing his own demons.

This dude just wanted someone to hold his hand while talking about how miserable he felt. When he tried reaching out to them he'd get nothing but silence. *Superhero Anonymous:* Please do not judge, we know what you did.*Batman*: What are you on drugs?*Dr. Strange:* I am not a magician!*Loki:* My sister is far cooler and less of a bitch*Deadpool* You're gonna die soon anyway so why bother crying over spilled milk?

","The world had never seen its end like it did that day. It didn’t start there, at least; it began years before, when someone managed to steal enough time in order to come up against the greatest threat known: *Depression*.

*Everyone knows of this.* The stories were told for generations as people gathered around campfires, children held their mothers close, and parents told them to never forget what happened before they took a nap. “And if you ever feel bad,” they would say, “do nothing. Do not even try to fight anything or anyone because there is always something worse out there, much larger and older than any person. There’s an entity far bigger than us all.”

“Why?” Would be a child’s question, and the response was “We don’t know how!”

People continued living as best they could but slowly more and more died off, some falling prey to whatever was out there, while others simply gave up completely after decades of mental torture. But then things changed; A powerful woman emerged from behind these shadows, she had defeated everyone and claimed everything, except for one last man who refused to submit himself to her will. He tried every trick, even asked what she wanted, just to appease her. She replied, “I want nothing, I only seek justice.”

His dark attire had not stood up well against the sudden shift of color around us. ""You must be tired."" He spoke first, though I already knew it to be true.

After all, what would I think after coming for days while I worked my heart bloody to keep myself sane? After this whole thing started, he followed close on the heels of every defeat. I saw him in the darkest of times when every shadow seemed worse than the last and even when the hope to find my way home still flickered.

""I am not tired."" It came out much like a sigh, almost too quiet as if I did not really mean it, or perhaps I dared not wish to speak aloud such a thing. But his eyes were wide as he said nothing. That broke the spell. The clouds parted and there in front of us was the entire city now bright white from both the sun that shone on its sides and from above it. A cloud swept over us, casting shadows across me again making my armor shimmer once more. All the colors we had seen in our travels appeared beneath that new blanket, red and blue and yellow as bright as I could imagine. There were faint smiles from the guards lining the streets but otherwise all remained silent, holding back their breath so they could see each other, only talking after their first reaction passed. Then he nodded slightly at least and I felt his face fall a little bit, which made him look rather sad indeed. I walked away from him, looking longingly towards the brightly lit homes ahead of us. He sighed again quietly and then I heard a deep booming voice echo off the side of some distant building.

I smiled then suddenly feeling energized yet also very small because there I saw one of my most hated figures again.

It was none other than Joker laughing heartily while throwing fistfuls of coins into the crowd. He ran past them, taking care to make everyone laugh by stopping every now and then and asking for someone to come closer and catch his money. At last he threw several pieces directly in the hands of poor old women walking dogs down the street while others held out a cup and begged him to throw something inside. As I hurried forward he stopped grinning at some young boy who pointed at me excitedly and I watched his grin change. This made the boy clap and shout and the woman next to him clap her own hands. Their joy filled me more intensely than any I had ever known before. They had no idea whose feet I walked behind and what fate awaited me but they had faith. That is why I chose this moment to approach him. The mask hid his features but through my keen understanding of his actions I could tell he liked it immensely that I wanted to confront him.

""Hello again."" I began cautiously. My steps became lighter with every word as the green cloak fluttered softly behind me, barely visible beneath the dazzling white of his costume. ""There is nothing left for us to talk about anymore."" I went on without pausing. Finally he turned his head to meet my eyes. The mask hid that expression but I could hear him say silently in his mind: That sounds interesting... ""Yes..."" he started and for the first time since he started following me I heard him truly think things. ""You are not tired?"" he asked back. His smile broadened as I continued. ""No nor are you depressed.""

He grinned wider, turning toward the crowds. Behind him, all heads whipped back around to stare at him again. Their mouths had dropped open. One man cried out in fear, clutching his chest as if choking, while another grabbed his wife's arm in terror, his large frame shaking with unbridled fright. None of those reactions touched me and all I felt was warm gratitude. Because when the green-cloaked figure took to running in the opposite direction I gave chase without hesitation, chasing him faster this time with full strength and confidence. He might be able to run circles around me, but I would not rest until he let go of this pathetic delusion that he could hide from the depression I carry within me.

When I finally caught up with him he tripped and landed with an audible crack of bone in the pavement. From this height I would never recover. Or rather, as soon as they picked me up with ropes and chains and carried me further from our destination - which was not far - to the doctor who promised the cure for his terrible affliction - I knew he had failed. Not in spite of it but because of it. And I understood perfectly why his depression was so strong to his people. Because anyone can choose not to wear their misery.

A man sits in his office, holding his hand up as if doing ""The Wave"" to greet the incoming group of workers that were entering his office for their weekly meeting.  His staff slowly enters until only he's standing in front of them; all with wide smiles on their faces and looking genuinely excited to be there. 

One woman from accounting approaches him first. She walks past other women from Accounting before coming to stand next to the one sitting beside his desk before she begins talking excitedly to him. ""Your office has been pretty quiet recently! How about we go out to lunch tomorrow?  What do you say?""

He pauses for a moment before nodding towards her while turning back toward the rest of his staff, giving each one of them the same look as her but this time everyone gets put on edge with a growing sense of dread.

""Yes sir,"" says the Chief Elf. ""Would your guess be...""

""5-6000, sir.""

He chuckles lightly but nods at the Chief Elf with a nod. ""Very well then!""

Another elf from human relations starts smiling nervously. He runs his hand through his hair and opens his mouth to speak while others start to mutter among themselves trying to get him to shut his trap. When it looks like he might give in, the boss takes another slow drag off of his cigarette before letting it out lazily into an ashtray shaped like the figurehead on the side of a viking longships. ""Yes, yeah, I'm thinking more along those lines too"" as he looks at the group he now expects to have the entire army of Christmas Cheer Inc on board his payroll soon. ""This place needs some money. Let's make sure that they feel comfortable working here though so maybe you could put together an annual christmas party once we're at full capacity""

He turns around facing his employees when he sees everyone turn towards him once again asking quietly what he wanted from them. The room was going to explode from excitement. After a minute of anticipation, he closes the door behind him and lights a lighter for his cigarettes after taking a puff from a single cigar that seems far too big for someone smoking the same brand as the woman who came in earlier. ""We gotta start making more money folks. These kids need me to be able to keep buying myself presents so that I can keep living the good life. And don't forget, I have a house right here on 17th Street that requires upkeep, you know? There is no way in hell I am moving down to 12th again when my mortgage payments skyrocket every year! And why would anyone want to live here anyway?""

The chief of staff shrugs shoulders nervously. ""The rent is cheaper than last year.""

He laughs heartily and sets the firestarter he just lit on his desktop. ""You see, that's something you people never understood. You thought it would make things easier for us, making these kids spend less cash and work harder so we could build bigger robots faster. Well let me tell you, nobody got any closer to becoming happy than us last year and we ended up needing to cut half our workforce because production went backwards.""

""There may or may not have been rumors that the company had decided to completely disregard the delivery of christmas presents altogether this year because we weren't producing enough units of our highly successful robot arm.""

The group starts clapping politely despite being confused by his sudden story but keeps watching him intently expecting something. One of the sales engineers speaks up saying quite timidly, ""That can't possibly be true.""

He points to himself smugly when the rest of the executives begin shuffling their feet. He throws their resumes out of his hands before taking a final puff of smoke and speaking calmly but harshly to the assembled team of disgruntled men before he blows it between his nose and cheeks in the form of a small plume of ash. ""Let me just ask you gentlemen, does Santa Claus ever tell you where he puts the milk left out on Christmas Eve?""

*Silence. Some nervous laughter from above.*

""See?"" *cough cough cough* ""Of course he doesn't!"" A tear rolls down his cheek as he wipes it away using the top of his hand. His voice cracks before he mumbles a barely audible response. ""And yet, we still continue to expect the impossible""

I'd already finished writing and putting all my gifts for everyone on the 'naughty-or-nice' list but when my parents came into me room I didn't think they were going to believe what I told them.

This one seems to be popular!

Here is another story:

A man gets laid off from his job as an elf at Santas Workshop he's been working at for 25 years. He cries and moans and complains about what a horrible place it is to work and how all their managers are greedy jerks until some kind strangers stop to listen to him. They come to find out the sad truth. When the man tells them the only reason he cried over being laid off (a big surprise) they realize something terrible has happened; the magic of Christmas is dying!



You could always have your own unique stories too ;)

""This is the worst year ever!"", a fat kid screamed while eating ice cream off of the side walks in New York City.

""Hey look, Timmy the kid yelled at Santa,"" laughed other kids behind him ""It's getting cold again""

""He's gotta be a bad boy,"" said Jimmy the reindeer.

""Nah, I think the problem is with us,"" said Blitzen. We're still doing good but we need more time. The poor little bastards had 12 weeks ago. How long do they take to make toys?

""Well if nobody else notices it's like a zombie walk down here - people aren't even trying anymore,"" replied Rudolph, staring back with wide red eyes. ""We should try making sure every last person gets a Christmas.""

""Don't worry, guys - I got it!"" shouted Kris Kringle with great confidence. ""There's nothing to panic. Just buy everybody stuff in advance. No pressure here, folks!

""Yeah dude yeah just get the money"", chuckled Bing Banga. ""Just keep those suckers coming.""

Rudolph started to fly away. I guess I needed a break too. I mean look at me! A giant talking unicorn sitting with hundreds of other reindeer. Nobody remembers Rudolph anyway. I wonder why. Maybe I deserve some cookies now after this crap shit crap trip all these assholes gave me today.

","The sun was coming up over the horizon, when I woke up in my bed on a snowy winter day. 

""What is this?!""

*You wake up as Santa's elf.*

I tried remembering what had happened - probably just another terrible dream about Christmas, but it didn't feel that way at all. My feet hit hard against the floor and I tripped over something - then I caught sight of one of my many piles of toy parts laying across the kitchen table. *I remembered: The last thing I ever saw before I lost consciousness was my neighbor holding a bottle of blue paint with red text. He said he wanted me to put some more details on the gingerbread house she built for me. Then there was the sound of my door lock clicking open ... then I lost consciousness. I have no memory of waking up.*

My eyes met an object in front of me as I made my way downstairs, its shape vaguely familiar, like those round, fluffy things you always see near Christmas lights. A small red book opened to itself in front of me, a large black eye staring back at me. Suddenly I heard two people whispering from inside a room upstairs. The voices sounded far away and distant: ""How do we get to his basement?"" - ""The other guy said that this place has a secret passage in here!"" Both boys suddenly started laughing and running toward each other, which ended only when they hit the side of the staircase. The rest of the evening passed like never before. They spent hours outside talking about life while drinking rum punch out of plastic cups, not a single snowflake touching them during their time outside. Even though I couldn't remember how I got into this situation, I wouldn't have traded this experience for all the world.

But today was a new start; if I really want to know what had gone wrong I should check inside again tonight!

","It's Christmas Eve and we've all been waiting for Santa Clause since October when he stopped his whole sleigh/dog sledding tradition.

But this year he's outdone himself. He doesn't just buy everyone stuff anymore he pays you! He basically pays everyone to leave their jobs or stay home, then rents out the North Pole and charges anyone wanting a present or simply visiting santa 8 dollars a month. That's right, for eight bucks you can have some time with him every year, but if you don't you get a tax notice from the IRS. Of course there will be an exception to the rule as long as you sign up before December 25th otherwise your tax bill goes up and up each month until January when they start again.

Now kids are paying 8 per year and the rest of society has to make ends meet while also being haunted by the fear that it isn't going to snow again any time soon and thus they wont have presents at christmas anymore.


The year is 2049 and the recession didn't recover from the late 2010's. Every house in every state is foreclosed on. The only people making money these days are businesses that donate food supplies and toys to ""charity"". All donations are tracked through blockchain so those companies know exactly how much money is getting donated and donates directly from other charity organizations. No one checks because its illegal and they fear jail time, which isn't scary enough considering most of the donations end up rotting away somewhere overseas never to be seen again. 

There hasn't been a case of fraud until now, but no one cares anymore anyway. Everyone hates themselves and feels like nothing matters, so nobody does anything about it. They figure they won't be here for too long either way.

","You will never be able to see this without a blue tint around your eyes, as is so common when you look at things through someone elses perspective, but for you it's permanent like a new glasses prescription, which makes people stare whenever they pass by you on the street, though nobody knows how your right pupil has become dilated all of a sudden.

At least once in everyone's life we experience it: the strange event that changed everything. It can be seen as an accident or a misfortune in hindsight, or could have been a divine intervention. Most often these events do not leave us changed at all. But some of us are more sensitive than others and feel our lives altered for good or worse after such an experience. There is no other explanation: time ceases to exist.

The universe itself must stop spinning for just a moment or two. When this happens one gets stuck staring at some object or person, not with sight, but with a kind of awareness, unable to blink. The only sensation from then on is time moving differently for them as compared to everybody else. And even if they try, they cannot change or control the changes in speed, except when staring into their own reflection. All that matters is the difference. Nobody will notice anything, while those moments of temporal displacement will make huge differences to them. One should think about the implications. This effect usually disappears after some time. The victim is back to normal until another such incident occurs again. If it becomes a recurring thing, they will begin to doubt their sanity and eventually end up being treated for schizophrenia.

","In my early years of life, I found myself constantly asking questions about almost everything that was going on around me. From how the sun moved in the sky to why birds flew south for the winter - it really didn't seem fair considering my parents were both doctors. Their answer was ""no one knows."" My response? No one *knows* but maybe if we ask someone they might tell us. It annoyed them greatly; this incessant questioning of all things that existed.

As I got older and older, every time something new would happen or people would do something, I'd stop and question what led up to that event or the why behind what they did. By the time I reached middle school, no one understood why I never joined any sports teams; or the fact I hadn't picked a religion yet. For years now I wasn't bullied by others because none dared as well as everyone assumed it was nothing. Yet when I asked other kids who couldn't figure out either topic - there reactions varied between curious laughter and complete disgust towards my intelligence that just sat in me. This is where the first bit of frustration started; seeing all these answers being thrown away and being mocked at in return. Even though these were my true feelings deep down inside, however whenever you get ridiculed for your personality, it gets hidden very quick. 

And then I realized... If nobody else could figure it out and make sense of it, maybe someone has. Maybe if you put enough effort into it, you could find it. And so I began looking at all of existence, finding flaws in logic and contradictions, trying to understand nature, and even the workings of human beings. For years I ran through everything trying to learn from past mistakes but none seemed to be correct. Or perhaps mine. Who can say. But with all of these attempts at understanding my world, I found that I wouldn't quit. In a few years time I went from not caring or laughing at jokes about me to genuinely feeling a connection to the joke because most of the humor is actually true. Jokes like 'if trees don't grow over their height they just fall over' are actually accurate and not funny until after you think about it for some time.  Funny stuff is probably just truth disguised as mockery; but hey isn't that what satire is? But back when I did laugh they still called me geeky. And once puberty hit it started getting worse from all the strange physical changes and odd quirks humans had come to accept as normal only came to me as more of an existential crisis (still). Now I wonder if it all makes sense after all, especially after learning that those are natural phases too. Like changing voice and hair color - it's natural change but you think it's abnormal. All of these weird experiences taught me patience. You start wanting it all to go away until your body catches up, but it doesn't matter you learn to enjoy it regardless of how much you want for a normal teenage phase. After all, everybody starts acting insane sometime. Even Batman does stupid shit. I tried using humor during these moments to try and connect with others but none understood. They just thought I was annoyingly serious, like I needed to know EVERYTHING, which I didn't. Some of these friends have been lost to fate or drifted apart since college. When talking to my remaining few friends in college they either laughed at me or ignored me completely. What little comfort they offered went down the drain in college as their lack of interest in my pursuits grew larger and larger to the point where I didn't bother speaking to them anymore.

It wasn't until recently that I found somebody remotely close to me. As she explained my reasoning behind her belief system and shared her own unique discoveries while listening to hers for centuries, all my frustrations faded away like smoke in the wind. Her name is Nadia, she told me it sounded greek or something similar. All I really remember were her beautiful eyes and long flowing dark blonde hair that always seemed to remind me of those mythical sirens that lured sailors onto shores with their sweet songs... A song my future wife sang when I kissed her for the first time - but that didn't exactly happen until after our conversation ended earlier. When the bell rang signaling the end of class she rushed over and hugged me tightly, then stood next to my desk with a smile on her face and held back tears - waiting for me to respond. My tongue felt heavy and slow when I answered her question: ""I-am-"" and before I could finish Nadia quickly cut me off and pulled my hand to her lips kissing it passionately and saying in my ear ""Welcome"". Then she walked over to her classroom and sat down. Not sure if I should be afraid or honored, all I could think about was hugging her back. She finally turned around and smiled as if to indicate for me to follow suit. The bell rings one last time and the two of us walk off together.

","The door slammed against his shoulder, making a dent in both of them with an ungodly bang. He blinked. It must have been the wind. ""Hello.""

""That's nice."" He stared for a moment at the stranger standing across from him, then quickly went back to staring at the closed car door where he heard the sudden knock. He watched it fall shut as if some giant monster was trying to kill his ears.

""You just told me you would help me."" His eyes fell on the stranger again and found their depths staring back at him. Their hair hung over their head, obscuring half their face and almost all of their other features that were otherwise impossible to make out. The only things they could see through the curtain of hair were two silver teeth bared in a snarl as though ready to bite off whatever remained behind them but didn't manage. One hand gripped a heavy pistol tightly in its webbed fingers. They never turned around, nor did they move one inch. 

""I will, I do."" This time, his voice carried no more than amusement rather than anything else. He leaned back in his chair. The room spun. There were countless moments like this when a similar scenario had played out but they never seemed to impact him directly. Sometimes he'd remember why he hated life sometimes he'd try to convince himself that everything was ok yet sometimes he would come into contact with people who either wouldn't let him go or couldn't stop him from running away. But today was one of those rare days when none of these situations were possible for him. Something about what I wanted to say resonated within him with every fibre of his being and kept driving home the truth of my words. So deep were his emotions at that point that he hardly remembered how he got up and opened the door to finally speak once more. In doing so he met the cold, hard gaze of his enemy. And the man slowly lowered the firearm towards him. That is if 'slowly' is the best description for something which was already done several seconds ago while the person in question still remained frozen in disbelief. They never turned around yet somehow he could tell from their posture how fast this little dance between both parties had gone. Now that it came to it, it was more than likely the first time she would ever meet someone that looked exactly like her, having grown up in that remote village where everyone basically resembles the others enough that there was not much variation at all. They walked backwards out of the room, leaving him alone with the shattered glass from the door still glistening in front of him.  No more knocking could be heard from outside. He took slow steps until they disappeared completely. His head wasn't in shock anymore. Nothing but sheer terror now occupied his thoughts as he rushed back to the kitchen to watch TV, hoping to drown out any sounds from beyond his walls. As the night progressed into dawn he was still unable to shake the feeling that someone was watching him from somewhere close by. He decided instead to call his friends over so he wouldn't be alone after all. ""There are too many monsters to fight by yourself"", someone whispered in his ear. ""It gets easier to live alone eventually but maybe you need somebody to cheer you up sometime? Just invite your friends over next time."", they said before he could answer.

But where were they? The same place that everything was – not here – never here and nowhere else. This strange occurrence happened several times during the day, once even when he went out for dinner. Where was his wallet in this moment? It would be sitting right beside him like always but he couldn’t see it through his eyes and could definitely not feel its presence as he usually did if he ran his hand along the side of his pocket, because he didn’t know what exactly was in there yet.

The Great Hero's Alliance did their best to delay us as long as they could until he had settled upon his new god name and then he went into hiding, claiming that 'it was an insult to him'. When his followers came knocking I politely declined any dealings with them, they started to follow me anyway so I eventually called out some demons who were passing by. The rest is history, I hope one day to see him again and find an explanation as to why he had to flee in disgrace. That is the reason that the demon hordes are so powerful today, those fools haven't been taught about how to control the forces of shadow magic properly.

When I came back to Earth there was no way that our allies at the time wanted us around. My first steps was onto the front lawn where my father-in-law stood, looking like the picture of grace and honour himself, I stepped forward cautiously and said ""Hi Dad."" He flinched back but kept his cool demeanor, I told him what happened and asked if I may sleep under the balcony for another night while I recovered from shock; my son looked very distraught because we had been arguing for days about whether or not to leave the house and now was a good opportunity. Apparently dad didn't know how to handle the fact that his son may be the reincarnation of evil incarnate or what ever he called his nemesis and walked away. That made things worse somehow. So naturally I spent the entire night wondering what the hell my brother was talking about and who the hell that guy at my door was and the neighbours seemed nice enough at least. What really sucked though was trying to move furniture without getting possessed by the great Evil God. It worked too well apparently!

But for once he wasn't yelling at me. He was yelling at everyone else. For whatever reason these people were upset with everyone else before him.

The woman yelled some kind of order though her throat tightened into a very hard knot. She stopped yelling when she started gasping for breath again.

My ears still ring with that sound. The soft sound was just as confusing yet somehow more powerful. But it had been so long since my time out, that it was hardly surprising at this point. My mind felt tired and hazy from living under pressure for two thousand years. To say nothing of how weak my current self was.

I hadn't had anything eat or drink while under that spell. In fact, neither had anyone else. Not even the people of the shadows. Which meant there weren't enough humans left over to help save us.

The women spoke again. I caught the edges of her words through the haze. ""Where is-"" she stopped as though lost for thought, then continued with renewed effort. ""Where is our king?""

Then another gasp escaped her lips, ""He's gone! Gone...""

A man broke into laughter before someone shut it off by forcing a knife against his neck. Even in such pain he didn't cease laughing. ""You idiot!"" he shrieked in agony, ""...the fuck are you doing!?""

One other person moved. They couldn't stay like this forever...but who knew if the same fate would befall the rest. One more fight. Two. Or maybe five? No, too many were already dead and there would not be enough left to make an effort.

","I don't know how I died. One minute everything was going as planned, and then the next everyone looked at me with scornful expressions and pointed their flaming deathly projectiles at my head. 

As it turned out the last bit of hope for my long life was gone that day. Ever since I was trapped inside one of the many dimensions of our little universe I didn't die once. Sure others were killed but by some stupid glitch in the system, or from an evil demon that came too close to taking me in his hand. In the end though no living things did a better job of keeping me alive than myself.

""Oh look! An extra level!"", a voice boomed above me in unison with a hundred voices. It belonged to the Dungeon Master. ""Yes that sounds nice doesn't it? You are given an ultimate ability! And before we get started lets review what happened here. As you can see I think this particular adventure went very well!"". The DM stopped. There was a heavy silence. We waited to hear what he had to say. 

Then he said, ""Well lets just start with you... huh? Where did your character go? Oh wait he's still there."" He walked over and took a picture of us in front of a statue made of stone: ""Why haven't you joined yet?"" he asked. Everyone gave him silent stares. After waiting for a while someone decided it was worth it to speak up. They had been watching and listening patiently, despite the sheer boredom. This brave soul spoke up ""The last dungeon master said he wants to give us ultimate abilities before starting the game!"". The other players nodded their heads in agreement. They heard so much from their dungeon masters about these abilities during prep and they couldn't bear to waste any more of the game hearing those boring old stories. They were ready for the abilities to begin already. 

Suddenly the DM slammed his fists on the table causing the dice, maps and tokens to tremble. He got extremely angry like he normally does if something goes wrong. We could feel a dark energy coming from him and shivered as if someone had just taken a large ice block to us. 

He shouted, ""No more talking. Now choose your ability!""

One of the other members raised his hand and replied, ""Sir, we are doing exactly what you ask!"". With this he chose a powerful spell to summon lightning. He cast the spell and created a massive orb filled with pure electricity crackling and buzzing violently. Before the others got the chance to intervene he cried out in pain holding onto his chest. His body became pale and slowly faded away from view until finally he disappeared into thin air. Apparently his magic burned him for having messed with the powers of the DM. 

We all knew the risk of playing with the dice. Once a rule changes every player starts thinking of ways to cheat. No way we ever thought we'd be the ones who broke the rules for the first time. For sure none of us felt scared or regretting our decision. None of us actually played DND for the actual enjoyment of the story. Playing with our friends for fun always comes second to earning enough gold to buy a luxurious mansion. And trust me nothing feels more luxuriuos than owning a million mansions!

It doesn’t look like he actually thinks about it much; as if an invisible hand was controlling his attention so that he couldn’t help but cast those eyes onto where *you* might be, in whatever corner or dimension *he* thought best.

There’s a reason why they don’t call me ‘the Great Architect,’ though. He’s just a simple warrior, even if his eyes seem brighter than all the others around him. And yet the fear in their gaze every time he walks by says more. The same goes for what else he will do; he’ll eventually come over here, to speak to me. Or worse: ask if he can have a drink too.

The other gods treat me like shit, which is what it feels like when I hear them mocking me. They mock me because they need some small excuse to get rid of me. “Too many wars.” So now I just stand on guard outside these dungeons when I know he’s coming. When nobody’s watching, maybe I swear a curse and make sure he gets thrown right into one too, the idiot deserves a taste of how pathetic I feel. A few times, I even managed to catch him trying to break out and fight through the guards myself. But then he would inevitably return to his own prison and I wouldn’t get a second chance to strike. Every now and again he’d also mention *your name.*

But today, I felt a strange surge from something inside me that had been dormant for years. Today, I walked towards him, ignored the terrified pleas of the remaining guards, looked straight into his face without fear and said: *“If I am supposed to kill everyone, please tell me who should I kill first.”*


And he simply smiled. For a moment, you almost could have sworn you heard an audible chuckle, full of laughter, before his voice boomed through the halls,*”God damn your insolence! Of course we both know I deserve a cup of whatever liquid you give us!” His teeth flashed white as he took the wine goblet before drinking heavily. This wasn’t arrogance; this was...this was joy, it felt like. Maybe after millions of years he actually enjoyed talking to someone? 

I knew I shouldn’t trust him, I knew that if he wanted to he easily could destroy me right now. But a part of me felt...excited. Could he perhaps not just want to rule now, but control? There weren’t many things he hadn’t seen in his centuries in power, and maybe this was new to him. Something inside me urged me to ask questions instead of running away.

It took weeks of asking if he ever saw the human race in its glory, about their art and music and love lives. What made them weak and what made them proud and why they were doomed regardless. Whether he knew about people or not—if he didn’t—it didn’t really matter. As he answered each question, a smile came to his face, a smile that spread wide as soon as he spoke his next word. It did no good, of course.

He didn’t answer any of my questions. Not at least right away. Instead, he told me stories—about humans; their history, their struggles and victories, about all the stupid stupid dumb things that went horribly wrong. You were probably wondering who this guy was, aren’t you? Well, guess whose turn it is.



<br> <br> Next Day:<br> 

I wake up in my office, tired. My wife died last week, she was happy finally free from me but I miss her terribly already. She loved reading, so I found another book, sat at the table with coffee and started reading. Suddenly, an alarm rings in the dark, red numbers on the glass show it's 6:00am in 2 minutes.

I rush to get ready. I have got to meet my friend tonight. At first, he seemed a bit mad I decided to call him ""friend"" and asked him to meet up with me at some nice cafe. Then I explained my problems and he agreed and told me he understood. That day we talked for hours until my hands began to tremble, I never told anyone about our conversation before since he promised secrecy, well except for my wife...but she was long gone before.

The fuck you just gave me? Gender switching is boring, and i didn't ask for that shit! I wanted to go in the direction of gender roles. It should be some kind of fucked up or bizarre scenario where everyone in the world finds out they have this power. You could make a whole genre of horror stories out of this...I bet you'd do a better job of it too!

There was no way anyone would like your ideas. This post came across as immature and lazy, and even though I liked it at first I regret it now! I hate how everyone loves ""fucked up scenarios"". At least make something interesting and original! Make it so we are able to understand what the character is doing while listening to their thoughts but it makes us think our own actions are being questioned all the time! If we want to change who we want we can switch our minds through telepathy but that means someone else has to give us consent to do that if not it goes bad fast, you know what happens when you don't get the right person for the job haha lol *everyone's mind fucking blowed haha*. Oh sorry about that, yeah make sure to keep these kinds of scenarios coming!

And by the way if the only reason why someone had mental powers is because they killed their abusive parents then maybe there isn't going to be any readers anymore cause i'm deader than meat and they should never have let someone like that live anyway

","The sun rose over Tynar as I stumbled out of my tent, blinking in confusion. The smell was different than usual. It wasn't the sweet scent of dew in spring or the crisp breeze that heralded the beginning of summer. No this smelled like iron, like blood, like smoke - it was the smell of death itself

I blinked again at the sky. There were four suns! Where could they have come from? Were there really four gods now? I never thought about how many we had, but suddenly everyone else seemed to be taking advantage of my ignorance. Was anyone even noticing what was happening in our world anymore? 

""Hey dude, wanna take a walk through the village?"" asked a voice as he stood in front of me. ""We have something for you.""

And then it came back to me: today was one of those times when my sponsors got together with other godsworkers to make sure things went smoothly. That meant someone would pick on a weaker fellow-god so that if all the new ones died off naturally their old god parents wouldn't get involved too. Then every couple of years when it seemed like no one was being picked, a real good sponsorship occurred where there actually might be some life left in us after all - then someone would win, then become a powerful and important god that would change our lives...forever....

This will be your last dance as gods, children of the one true God: we are but mortals like you once, now only remnants that hold together a broken body after it has been torn apart at random so to speak. You were chosen by luck for a chance to step in a place where no god was able, and each of you has fought harder than anyone else—now, however, you face it in unity: together on your deathbed. With two souls fused into one they have lost their individual strength. The old world must pay its dues and reap what they sowed. Only when everyone dies or when every hero is dead in our current age can this cycle repeat itself anew. Your champion is gone for good, for as his soul was bound unto yours you may forget him as soon as he is done serving your purpose. He could still be here today. What if he wasn’t called back until after the next cycle starts? It is said that only then do those who die save themselves through reincarnation. We shall see whether that is indeed the case. Until that time the spirits shall forever be bound to us, and thus we must keep our duty. And please, try not to make too much noise lest you awaken our slumbering champions.

","He didn't look at her like she was different. She had been his daughter for nearly thirty years when she first entered the temple walls that lead through the mountain to the Great Trials. He knew it would be difficult seeing as how both of his eyes were blue and mine were green. But she always saw him just like anyone else-  As if I weren't really there.

They wouldn't get used to our difference because we all know each other so well.

I was only the youngest this year. That's why they let me go to the Trials. Most people forget that I did in fact have *two* sons named after Gods. And the fact that they are literally two of the most powerful gods known to man on their respective planes don't hurt anything either. Not even more so than my 18th birthday, which wasn't until a week after this year, when The Elders Council decided I could partake in the Trials. I was young, weak and dumb enough not to even realize. It took many months but I finally figured out what was going on. They let me take part in the Trial though because I grew up in the Temple since my parents brought me here when I was three. So that counted for something right? A lot of families come to the Temple once an every seven years to try out for the trials. But few make it back alive or win the sponsorship. I guess that doesn't matter much unless you are trying to become a god yourself, then it does!  



My father died tragically during one of these trials about twenty years ago now. He fought valiantly and won. Then he died from the poison caused by the toxic chemicals that made up this mortal world. Everbody thought he would never live to see a hundred years old, and especially he certainly couldn't imagine living through another trial. But no- he beat the odds again.

That was over seventeen years ago now. My brother took my place in this cycle and has already been to the Trials eight times successfully. It is his turn next year. My father gave me special powers that allowed me to enter before age limit: I am immortal and capable of controlling elements, healing others and turning into animals (which proved very handy in several battles). By the time my sister takes her turn I hope to have gathered enough wealth and wisdom to start using my powers wisely.  The greatest challenge will not be beating enemies- but avoiding dying in the process itself!


I can do the trials alone of course. Since I am immortal I can simply avoid fighting death. But to truly achieve immortality I need power bestowed by God. To give me power he must die. That makes things a little hard.   He isn't dead yet-  he doesn't intend on killing himself anytime soon anyway. Plus if he were to kill himself any day soon I wouldn't want to be the one who found him- Especially since it probably will be my fault since all of us have to train with each other at the Temple. Besides that we spend our lives together training for these trials, playing games, sharing secrets etcetera. This bond between siblings is invaluable. If I betray him I lose the bond. I can't betray him.

This might sound confusing but I bet everybody thinks this way at least sometimes. When you think about your family life versus all your accomplishments in a competitive sport and vice versa. Both seem equally valuable.  I love the idea of getting sponsorships though, being seen as strong and important by a god. All my brothers were able to do that after joining their teams. Even some members of the younger generation managed to accomplish that despite barely graduating highschool! I can practically taste the glory by just thinking of the opportunities ahead of me. Perhaps more importantly is the opportunity to meet someone nice. Of course you don't want to choose some random guy like those who came last - at least not necessarily. You don't want the guy whose mother still married him due to pressure from family and his lack of choice. Those guys end up doing awful things when they reach godhood. One would think they would be the exception but alas it turns out there are loads of them.  One could always pick a pretty girl too, of course. There are many beauties among the mortals, I'm sure I met plenty in my four hundred years of walking across the surface world. Still they all look just as stupid compared to the goddesses that run around here. No contest there! Of course I haven't really looked at anything since I joined the Temple. Every time we were together I always kept looking at him. How I wish I could actually marry the girls without ruining everything. What if his wife betrays his trust. Or maybe she starts spending less time with him. Like a cat and mouse game, the longer you play the better chance you have at becoming a god. Well I hope that at least happens since my best buddy got tricked in to giving me some kind of divine intervention on accident while watching soccer. Guess what happened next?! My best friend went off and killed a thousand men to prove his righteousness. Yeah that kinda ruined our friendship a bit. 


What a dick! Some people say good boys don't cheat and true friends stay loyal to each other, but I guess some people just hate betrayal and loyalty. Just kidding.


But no! I refuse to abandon my best friend's wife just like he abandoned his. We'll overcome this obstacle! First step, admit that it's okay if we stop eating each other after betraying each other. Second step? Wait until everyone has moved on with their lives. Third, move on from everyone and forget about those experiences entirely so you can focus on the present moment and enjoy life the best you can. Lastly, hopefully your second chance comes along and it's worth it.




""Hello my lovely."" I said nervously. ""It's great to meet you! Would you mind if we ate lunch now?""

","“Today I give you all your choice, the world will be saved or destroyed!”

The god of wisdom spoke with solemn voice that could shatter mountains into dust but which at times was as loud as the roar of thunder across the entire sky. The warriors who gathered in front of him, heroes from dozens of different countries stood together for the sake of their homelands and were not willing to sacrifice themselves on his altar any longer. 

They weren't afraid - they had faced the wrath of their gods, they had seen monsters and demons even before the old ones left their holy realms and came to bring ruin over the innocent peoples. Yet many stood still now, unsure what to do next. Some looked downcast upon the altar itself; others bowed their heads while some began to weep out of fear and sadness knowing that the gods would have just taken someone else's youth away from them yet again. And that one day, they too will join them.


A young man stood on top of the pyramid-shaped throne made of solid rock. He wasn't quite as tall as his fellows but in the eyes of most of those present, he was much more brave than he seemed. There was no doubt that he belonged among them and no matter which of the Gods he chose to serve with, it would be the Gods honor that kept him alive as the elder God said ""Only God knows whether you win or lose this race."" They may have won today or been chosen later through battle. But whatever happened today, only time would tell.


And so both groups, those who volunteered and others were sent forth towards each other in an arc across the plains of white gold like an arrow being shot by its bowman.  And slowly, death began eating away at the number of adventurers that took part in the ritual. Even though there weren't many contestants, the war raged on. Eventually even the armies of Gods began fighting against each other and a great battle ensued between gods and their followers until eventually the two groups met in a duel of steel where neither surrendered nor gave in without throwing every ounce of their power into the fray.



""Why does the elder God choose me?"" The youth asked himself several thousand times during his journey before becoming aware that something wasn't right. There were far more gods watching him than he knew how possible it could have been even when he entered into combat with each rival deity and survived long enough to escape their scrutiny unscathed. What if these gods had known him before? Or maybe he was wrong about the age of wisdom...what if he'd been lying to himself for all those years?

But no answers presented themselves. Thus he continued forward along his path, unaware that his enemies are behind him. Not that he cared anyway since he felt that no matter how hard either side fought he wouldn't gain anything but hurt from winning or losing. Either way, he knew he would die because that's what happens when the ages start taking you down.

","The text was blurred, but I could still make out the words “you know what to do” and “do it now”.

“Damn… how did they get into my phone?” I cursed under my breath. I was too far down for cell reception at the moment so I had to call them instead. To my surprise she answered immediately. 

“Hello? It’s Jason! Do you have any idea where you are?” He responded after a few long seconds of silence before getting right to the point, though his tone seemed odd. His voice sounded distant yet strained at the same time, almost as if he was trying to hold back some sort of emotion. Whatever it was probably best not to confront him about it at this time.  I told him that I didn’t know, but that I would find something.

“Well whatever happens, don’t tell anyone.” Was all he said. Then he hung up. Fuck. This sounds weird… I thought to myself while putting my ear buds back in.

My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet and I couldn’t fall back asleep despite knowing exactly what I had to do. After having run for hours, the only thing that kept me going was the thought of being able to come home and finally see Sarah again. That night when things got bad, my phone had sent me another text. This one looked like a picture of Sarah, sitting in a hospital bed with tubes and wires sticking out of her arm, her skin white and sallow. 

It was pretty horrifying to see. But it wasn’t the photo itself that bothered me most, though I’d heard whispers and rumours before seeing it happen, this is why this message came through - it took years away from both our lives and we were just thankful to see each other again once more, but neither of us had much hope left. Yet here she was in the throes of life once again, still beautiful, healthy and happy despite everything she had been through. 

I ran into school to get as far away from the building as possible. Running into class seemed daunting in its own way, so I figured I’d run outside during recess. As soon as I stepped into the halls of hell, a scream rang out across the student body before a loud thud went over head along with a lot of yelling about guns and death. My heart skipped a beat, but luckily my hands weren’t shaking. Even though those bullets hit their marks, there were many people who made it out without a scratch. Still, my vision clouded over and I felt weak, shaky, scared. This couldn’t be real. This isn’t happening. No, it couldn’t…

","I never thought I would be running for my life today and no part of me was ready at 2035.

It hadn't been difficult before. Everything had always felt so safe; the world we grew up in had seemed so easygoing and free to explore. We thought all that mattered was love, and by definition, nobody knew what kind until they got it anyway. At 18, most people are just out of high school, and after three years later college has become less about education than about finding out who you really are. People went into relationships with absolutely nothing but an ambition and a dream and hope that one day both could share. It is like building blocks - if you stack them right then everything comes out perfect in the long run. And some did! When you think back to when you were younger and your childhood sweetheart told you that 'once married there will be nothing left to do except raise children', it sounds pretty depressing, doesn't it? Because of course you don't have kids yet and neither does she - but even still, you can already imagine yourself being able to work on your career or finally going abroad and seeing places you only dreamed of. If any of this was possible now you wonder why you have not worked harder. Even as adults having dreams meant anything and growing old together, you could see yourselves doing so many things, exploring new cultures or climbing mountains.

It wasn't supposed to end like this. Our generation thought they held control over their future - it was like being born with something special. A little different spark of life given to us to shape our lives. But none of us knew how soon it would disappear and change from that spark into a burning, scorching flame. The apocalypse started almost instantaneously. From nowhere everyone learned about a dark entity that looked like a cloud covering the night sky and came down upon Earth on August 29th, 2065. For five days it hung above everyone, leaving behind nothing but terrorized towns and desolate ruins. Every city and town was completely demolished with zero warning or trace of a clue where the hell it came from, or where it went after wiping out Earth. As of today, November 7th, the mysterious event seems more like a story for those who haven't learned to live without a hope and faith in something better. Everyone knows somewhere there exists an alien race watching out for us.

The world ends one way or another every hundred years, usually because humanity decided to fuck itself over (there was always wars), so we were taught, maybe, because somehow these aliens also managed to wipe out other planets for themselves. They saw an entire galaxy covered in dirt and grime, humans were too busy trying to decide between eating meat or not that they didn't notice us, but their intelligence detected and measured our existence. It took billions of years for them to figure out what we were trying to build - a home, a civilization, anything, and eventually decided to destroy our pathetic, fragile planet. After killing our civilizations in the blink of an eye they sat back and watched us slowly die one by one. I found myself staring at the image through my window as I waited for someone from the other side of my apartment door to come talk to me, knowing full well that he couldn't. My hands trembled a little and he said he needed to leave. What's wrong with you? Why won't you answer your damned phone?! I wondered aloud. He didn't respond. Nothing but silence. The rest was history.

What kind of person takes someone else's call and decides to go kill him? That must be what my murderer thought while running away across the street. Maybe that is how much distance separates me from getting shot dead, who knows? All I know is this guy has to come find me again. And for once I am glad I forgot which route I took coming here last time.

But what have you seen? How much longer will you last if no one is there to see it. You do know I will be watching you, don't you.


I stood there before him, staring at his face, my heart pounding in my chest as he looked back at me. We didn't speak, though my mouth began to form words again and again until finally breaking the silence by screaming in rage: ""How the hell did this happen?!""

But where does it go? It comes back, just like every other sentence I try and make before being drowned out by silence, but why now? I feel myself slipping away, leaving me powerless against whatever forces are conspiring against me.

And yet, for some reason, there remains something more to say. Some questions to ask. This isn't over yet, I am not finished. Where are they? And most importantly...why. 

I don't want any of these things, none of them should exist. They are nightmares made real.

My fingers reach for something around my neck, grabbing tightly onto the small silver pendant dangling from my chain. Maybe it has something to do with it; maybe not, but its always been with me so it can only help right now.

The world fades into white noise as I begin to lose strength, gasping once, twice, then nothing at all. There is nothing else to say. No need left. She watches with pitying eyes, waiting for me to end, but it ends in itself.

She looked around and saw the empty dark hallway with its ominous black walls before realizing that the phone had slipped out of her hand all along. 

She picked it up cautiously, checking if anyone could've seen it before reading the message and replying in plain text. 

**Unknown:** ""Hey! I found something really interesting. A guy was asking about himself, but didn't want people knowing his true identity because he claimed that it was too embarrassing. So naturally I decided to ask him for some details so I can help him, and guess what? You gave me your real name!"".

There wasn't even any replies and no return calls. It's been two days already. The suspense kept building as if someone's watching her or something. That same day, two weeks ago (she thought) another message pops up. This time, it wasn't in plain text, but simply just a photo of her in a room, alone and wearing nothing. Her reaction at hearing that must have broken some record at her local hospital as they had to rush in and check on her because she screamed and ran out of the building crying hysterically without anyone noticing since her boyfriend arrived shortly after, looking confused. 

She still hadn't received any new messages. Two more weeks came and went by and one thing started to feel increasingly weird than any other. Her own mother called her saying ""you have got mail!"" when picking up from school. Now she feels relieved, hoping it might be someone finally calling to talk with her but alas no one answered when she clicked the 'call' button. 

After a month, the numbers were always blocked and wouldn't show anything. The mystery seemed neverending. Weeks later, on New Year's Day as usual, she waited for the family's arrival while eating dinner, and just when her eyes were starting to get heavy again from all the scrolling she did today online looking for who might've done this - another random message popped up! Not sure why, she felt a sense of relief and excitement. She looked at it quickly and read the simple text message: ""It's not us. Run!""

This is probably how most of his victims experienced things: terrified at being so surrounded by ghosts and yet so alone as they heard them whisper.

He sits in this old rocking chair while I hold up his name card. He knows exactly what kind of job he got. After all, nobody asks for help unless there is something wrong going on in their life. He wasn't one to ask for it either--he had never tried before... 

His death was unusual in itself: While attempting a paranormal autopsy on himself via suicide note-assisted dissection (don't bother trying to find him, it is far funnier to imagine), it seems some sort of electrical surge set loose an experiment that went horribly right or horribly left based on whoever's perspective you choose. You're not allowed to say ""one"" without thinking twice, because every single person will answer differently. And then only people who know the secret answer have any knowledge. So much more mysterious than what it started as. Just another guy wanting to be known as an infamous ""ghost hunter"".

","It wasn't *always* about the dead. I know, right up front.

A week ago this might have sounded like a silly story on the internet. But trust me - it really happens every day all over the world. 

Right now the whole ghost haunting thing is just in the news (thanks Wikipedia) and everyone believes it. You could try asking around and see if anyone knows of actual ghosts. They do! More than you can count. If they were real then there would be no secrets left hiding around here. And nobody is dumb enough to tell them otherwise, too - so long as they actually *are*.

","As a soul enters the next plane, if there's an exit point they always ask. A sort of hellish IRS audit in which spirits are interrogated by heaven-appointed demons and must answer for their sins while still living, or lack thereof

They often ask these questions before being banished back into limbo. I assume they're looking for some sin to blame themselves, like my boss (who'd kill himself out of greed) or the person who hit his motorcycle as he ran that red light while drunk, leaving him broken up forever after 

And so on... But sometimes people just come up asking the same question all over again. It's boring. No new information can be gleaned from them because they know exactly what happened when they died

So i gave the newest soul who sat down across from me with a drink an empty bottle and watched him finish it

If only it were just *someone* that came over to interview me instead of *hundreds*.

You ask him what you should call him because everyone who comes by has a title: Mr. Johnson-Johnson/Mrs. SmithSmith, or Master KingKing/Ms. DavisDavis and no one can tell why. There is always so much pressure to be sure there's more than one person here asking you how you survived, or worse - they want to thank you for saving their loved ones from the void before the accident. No, not even then, those are usually in charge too.

So when it's the boss who interviews you, you take every precaution. A lot of it is useless, like not wearing any jewelry at all and putting some duct tape over your eyes so no one could see the holes in between your teeth after eating. The other people try and warn me but they never quite get through, ""A few cuts won't hurt.""  No, honey, a cut won't kill a 17 year old dude with a bunch of fancy scars on his arm and missing leg. It really isn't easy finding a job when you look like this anyway though.

It wasn't that long since he looked like *that.*

What really worries me about what he looks like now, however, is that I'm supposed to say that. He actually does too. That's his thing, he brings a clipboard and gets right to work. Then asks the same questions: Where do you come from? Do you know anyone else who works here? What were you doing before this job was posted, etc.  And whatever he asks you back, you say exactly that. Even if the answers make absolutely no sense. One of my greatest concerns coming into work today was that nobody ever bothered reading anything I said.

Which was probably a good way of going out, wasn't it?

You think about all the things that happened prior to meeting Johnathan Miller's father, such as your father being extremely wealthy and powerful business man. How he owned everything important around where you grew up. How everybody wanted to be *him* after high school and everyone believed he didn't need to do any other sort of work at least until retirement.

He did however end up getting a job selling insurance companies some sort of new technique called *telemarketing* which turned out to be absolutely terrible for him at first. But after working at it awhile, he ended up loving it. He really understood what went into it, making it hard to turn down the commission he'd given himself as well as the bonuses that kept adding up every quarter. Once he'd gotten the hang of it, the company even started hiring more employees, leading to Johnathan becoming something of a mentor of sorts.  This was especially important when it came to training his daughter to start applying her education elsewhere.

Johnathan found out about our family's issues the first time *we* got rejected to an academic program. We thought we just weren't good enough, and I guess neither my husband nor I really knew much at all but she still decided to try and convince us otherwise. Luckily, that's where **she** stepped in to help...





""There's nothing stopping you! Why don't you put away those stupid pamphlets you're carrying and let her run for governor!"" Mrs. Smith insisted, shaking the copy out of my hand. And yeah, she made me do it. 2 weeks before graduation, under threat of leaving college altogether. For *her* sake obviously. At age 19, it took some convincing, but once she hit my dad she had the rest of the conversation covered. She explained the whole concept of campaign ads, the target audience, demographic shifts, and political platforms. Just because something is impossible doesn't mean it can't be done without proper execution. Besides, it wouldn't be much of a life anyway if you couldn't do something awesome with every opportunity.



Turns out, we did alright. When I say ""alright"", it's a bit of a lie. I'll explain a little later, so just nod if you agree ;)

","It all started innocently enough. An email from a mysterious company asking for donations was forwarded to me. I clicked through thinking it was spam. The link appeared harmless and I clicked anyway, then I died. My phone lit up like crazy. Not one but two people called saying ""You are dead"" simultaneously. Two different cell phones.

I got into my car just in time to see my body sitting in an ambulance on the side of the road as police officers and paramedics ran around looking frantic. A guy in blue with white stripes pointed at the windshield and yelled something about the ""accident"". He asked what my insurance coverage was, then went back inside. It took 30 minutes before anyone could reach out to my family. They did explain things were tense, they were worried someone had targeted me because of who I am. But honestly, knowing how badly I had been hated even before this all started didn't surprise them much. At least not really. As news outlets showed footage of my death they blamed me and I became a trending topic worldwide online. I hadn't been popular, even when alive.

Being born in a poor household living in rural Ohio I grew up with little money and worse luck. After school was finished (which wasn't long) I worked many jobs none of which could save me. Money was never an issue after inheriting millions upon inheriting millions thanks to my father working with several large corporations he knew personally. Most of these companies shut down due to a crash in stock prices but his friend left him the rest of the money. His assets were worth less due to taxes but that meant no more money for any IRS audits. For that reason, we lived pretty comfortably although only having 2 kids and letting the other be adopted by friends who needed another child allowed us to give away some of our wealth while still making ends meet. Even so, I felt like a failure and continued applying for jobs until I found nothing. Then came the day everything changed. During an interview for a job as manager I was told off when I mentioned how my uncle helped me find the job. Apparently there was a reason I passed through all these security checks: I was their target. All those interviews were pointless attempts to see why I had such a well-known reputation without being able to get me fired or killed. Their employers wanted to know *who* I was. Not *how*. In fact the interviewers were more curious as the test progressed into getting hired rather than trying to make sure I couldn't do the job. Finally they brought me to an office where they looked over every detail of my life, checking records, credentials and contacts while comparing them to mine. Finally I stood up to leave when the interviewers said, ""Tell us why you're here."" We talked about the past and future. They told me to join their group. Before leaving they handed me my first mission badge. I knew why the interviewers wanted to get to know me that much. There were far fewer secrets in human nature compared to the corporate world, and trust is hard to come by. That's why once they knew who I was they chose to let me live. Now, after ten years... I think I made a mistake, though.

","I knew it was going to come, as any decent doctor does when confronted with a deadly illness in his patient's mouth. I looked at her now face-down on the operating table: an enormous tumor of cancerous flesh covered in blood. She sat there frozen for one minute, waiting, and then she smiled. And cried. And sobbed quietly through tears streaming down her face before finally, as if she realized the inevitability of it all, saying ""Get in."" 

It made me wonder why she put so much effort into getting married if she wasn't even happy. Still, we moved onto what was left of her body, prepping for surgery as best as I could. After putting a mask and surgical gloves on, my hands felt cold. Cold as they were, I felt no shiver despite how chilled my breath became upon closing the door behind me. It didn't matter how much air I breathed in while watching her; or how hard I tried to focus during surgery, knowing full well what I was about to do. 

The camera cut back from the scene where the tumor was removed.

""Dr. Jones,"" said Mrs. Johnson, still strapped up but smiling.

""Ms. Johnson,"" I greeted.

There was something deeply unmoving yet strangely calming about her eyes. Like she couldn't wait for Dr. Jones to leave but also didn't want him to. Her breathing seemed slow. Almost rhythmic like when the heart beat slows prior to death. The rhythm did accelerate slightly right after I opened the door to let her husband in again. 

""Dr. Jones,"" continued Ms. Johnson.

""Yes?"" 

She sat with her head tilted sideways looking as though she wanted to say another thing to me. 

We both stared at each other in silence for two seconds until I asked her ""Did you want to...""

""Yes,"" finished Ms. Johnson.

After some more conversations with nurses who gave us privacy and closed the door to their room, the tumor was excised. As always, it was not easy. There was blood everywhere. Even my gloves didn't stop the stain. But this time it seemed there was far less fear. And once again, there was excitement. A new adventure. One that came with its own price.

A small smile crossed over my lips, making me look a little less morbid. 

As soon as the tumor was removed, I went and told the nurses to call for the anesthesia team. We got to work quickly, leaving the patient unconscious so she could be wheeled down to recovery in perfect condition. While this was happening, the camera cut to her husband sitting next to her bed, crying tears he hadn't shed since they met ten years ago. The doctors talked and debated amongst themselves in hushed tones, probably discussing details of what Ms. Johnson had done. Or perhaps just gossip with each other. I really wasn't paying attention because I needed everyone else to hurry up and finish their work so I could get paid. At this point, it seemed impossible for them to continue talking unless they started speaking Spanish. I turned my attention back to her, and as the last bits of anesthetic were being removed, I took out my phone to take a quick selfie of my patient. 

When the first nurse arrived by my bedside, I pointed out the error in her work.

As expected, Ms. Johnson woke up immediately. Smiling broadly, she said ""Thank you, Doctor!"" 

And thanked the cameras too. When I returned the thank you photo I shot of my patient to the hospital nurse, she gave me money. I thanked her for her charity and took a step closer, ready to accept payment for medical services rendered. With shaky hands I tried to count the dollar bill. My phone rang, sending an alert that read ""Incoming Call - Dad"". I picked up, expecting my parents to ask if I had called home and missed them today in order to help save my patient's life. Instead, the voice of my mother said that Mom had run into Mr. Smith at church later than usual, and saw him walking toward the bathroom in the sanctuary. He looked terrified and asked if anyone else had seen anything unusual happen. My family didn't believe me. Nobody believes patients who die anyway, especially those whose deaths are the result of something entirely avoidable, as in this case. My dad walked out without giving further explanation.

The thing is not every demon is crafty or cunning enough as me.

It wouldn’t be worth it if your sins included petty theft though; nobody cares about petty thievery among the demons because only some are actually aware of where their stuff goes after they are possessed by you etc, and even then all they really steal is people's minds. What I did take pride in was my ability to manipulate emotions, yes I am talking about the kind humans like in love, anger, jealousy, sadness, despair, hatred etc. Even worse yet...

Now here I was, sitting in a church hall with every single one of my fellow classmates having more muscles on display than I did when I signed up.

“Alright everyone! Today is the day!” said Sister Agatha holding out a crucifix and staring menacingly at me. She hadn’t expected me though, because her usual targets were those big hairy things called ‘Orlocks’ or something like that…or maybe they just had weird hair cuts. My fault, really. 

Now after six weeks straight of studying demons, I could hardly believe I’d found myself standing before them, ready to kill. Or get eaten by. Well now, it doesn’t matter which would be preferable either way, as long as I didn’t die right afterwards. I was a large guy to begin with; most of our training consisted of running laps around the old block with these ridiculous whips made of feathers.  Maybe if they tried to fly away from us during the last lap then we might find some actual leverage for a proper ass kicking…maybe.  But no, all five fat lumps simply sat there in their seats.  Even the little bitty girl from yesterday wasn’t allowed back into the course today. What kind of hellhole does anyone think this is anyway?! 

I mean come on, not even the damn priest wants to touch me anymore, but how can he when I barely look at him properly? When we had lunch together once, he choked back his saliva in surprise and almost spat out whatever he was eating on me. Who’s the man-god himself when your very life depends on him?!

So much better off without these pathetic freaks who probably won’t ever stop worshipping other people like idols while I’m left to rot here in purgatory. Not really sure what happens to people who manage to survive this hell hole but nobody goes home unless they actually slay another demon. That’s the only way out - or so Sister Agatha claims.

He screamed and begged but all that came out were moans and gurgles as I pulled off his prosthetic eye ball, then dropped it on his lap. All he could do is let go of himself. Then I moved down his arm as much as I dared so I could get a good look at my favorite type of guy-guy

One word. ""Daddy"".

I didn't kill him. He knew what I wanted when I asked to look and looked away from him just long enough. Not even one second really, but long enough. He never lived through another night. And now nobody comes here.

","It had been a tough century for humanity. The end was nigh and everyone realized it when they saw their own death coming, yet no one seemed to care.

For you, death meant boredom. After all, you could live forever, or at least longer than anyone else would, but the pain never truly went away. As each decade came and went your body grew weaker and more feeble, yet your memory remained sharp as ever. You watched millions die out from old age over and over again, only getting worse as time progressed. Even worse, those whom died first began noticing these memories come back and so did their awareness of everything that you'd observed before. Now your brain became clouded with the knowledge of what your eyes had seen; every murder, torture, disease, war and genocide... And your last few centuries made it seem like there wasn't any hope left, either. If anything, all this gave rise to is fear... Which slowly killed you yourself. One final desperate act led you to this present day: Prison. At least now there was some meaning to this endless torment.  But it hadn't been an easy task finding someone worthy of running the facility. Eventually, thanks to the work of the Warden and Head Counselor, I found myself in the room where many prisoners would go through their daily rituals... Of reading books, smoking cigarettes, whispering prayers, crying over a loved one, etc., etc. 

""What do you want?"" she said coldly while holding her mug between two hands, still looking straight ahead with little emotion displayed on her features. This woman had given me little reason for hope at first glance. But then again, most prisoners here were nothing but pathetic excuses for humans.  After sitting down, she asked: ""Do you have something you need? Any request for a favor?"". Her voice became more welcoming once hearing my answer: ""I've noticed many of them here have lost hope in their lives"". 

Even though her face remained neutral, I managed to hear her thinking: ""That sounds strange, but fine. Who are you anyway? Name?"". To answer her question with honesty, I answered directly: ""Im John-8726825-b, but they just call me John. Maybe one day they'll remember my name better if I do him proud."" With that being said, I pulled out a photo of myself taken not even ten years prior (My hair and beard had turned white since then). It was good enough! She accepted the photo and said: ""Okay, well it looks like we found our new warden"". We sat there for awhile, talking about life here, how people were dying around her, how sick of watching others suffer she was, and eventually how much better things would be with new leadership. Soon after I showed up at work, I felt like I already knew this place like the back of my hand. 

A lot changed under my watch: The inmates are finally fed properly, they don't sleep with their shirts off anymore (that was nasty) and they shower regularly. They started picking jobs again which they took advantage of with great excitement while working hard and quickly learning valuable skills; I can tell because their faces are actually smiling for a change. Not only were they happy, the guards didn't feel sad anymore: their sense of duty had risen and they weren't afraid anymore. A very nice lady replaced the old guard captain and gave us a huge bonus to celebrate the big changes we had created. Finally, peace reigned once more in the place and I finally felt relieved of having gotten the chance to serve a sentence, however bad it may have looked by outsiders.

","The only person with a higher ranking then me was one dude in a cell next to mine. It had been ten months since the incident and he hadn't moved from his chair for the better part of that time, talking about how much he hated it all so much. This made my job easier but I still checked on him every two weeks because I would make sure his food wasn't tampered with, always kept in his cells some sort of soft drink of his choice to prevent over consumption of alcohol as is common amongst the inmates here which gets the inmates up in the mornings more willing to participate and makes it hard to keep them awake during morning roll calls, kept his hygiene products in full stock. I had gotten along with the whole gang so far until today. He turned around when i walked in and stared at me. The cold stare locked eyes on mine.

 ""They were gonna bust my door last night."" *he said.*

""I thought they weren't gonna come."" Said the new guard. *He looked down ashamed*. ""Im sorry if something happened while we slept,"" she spoke kindly to help ease his mind.

""Yeah...I appreciate it. Did your boss send you?"" *he tried holding eye contact but couldn't*

*my jaw felt like I could break it from clenching so tight*, ""yeah why? Were you planning something too?"" I asked, trying not to sound stern but also wanting my question to be clear. That damn kid really thought he could hold a grudge this long and never gave up on getting out. How did they even find him though? We didn't tell anyone where he was hiding anyway!

That son of bitch...that little rat! He betrayed me for someone else I think. Someone probably rich enough to bribe a half dozen guards to let their friend get away. Or they just wanted revenge for me beating him to death right before leaving the station. Either way I was pissed off.

*""what's up bro?""* I hear myself say to another inmate. His mouth was open wide, waiting for an order of any kind.

I started laughing hysterically and he seemed scared

""*you're funny, bud! Whatcha doing in jail?"" *I laughed louder, tears coming down my face. Everyone thinks its ridiculous; they can't believe I'm actually enjoying being a monster, but all of my life there were demons inside my head telling me otherwise.* 

This one grinned and asked again:*what's wrong?*

*nothing just came to mind...oh wait!* I started coughing and wiping some tears out my mouth. ""*fuck you buddy!"" I cried looking back at the other inmate. *Do ya wanna play hide and seek? If you wanna play, well let's go!* I yelled, laughing at the look on the other man's face and grabbing his hand.*

Well shit fuck, guess tonight doesn't matter either now! I got my escape route now! And I ain't gonna give up this soon! They wouldn't see it coming either! It all went according to plan....or whatever bullshit mental stability I have left might call it a plan..



<br>
---------------------<br>

As I rounded the corner toward the hole in the wall leading into my bedroom I heard it all. The voices, the screeches, the pounding. At first I thought it was just one or two guards fighting, but I soon realized there was a lot of them. In fact there was a LOT of them. I jumped down from the wall and slammed through the metal bars, the others giving chase.<br>
***

A bunch of guys ran towards us screaming ""We found him!!"", they were running at full speed towards us.  There are multiple people holding guns shooting them. There's a big commotion happening, lots of screams and gun shots but everyone seems unaware of what was going on above their heads. For a second everything stopped. My knees felt as if I could rip my own bones clean out of my leg. My muscles felt as if they were about to snap apart. I fell down to my ass shaking uncontrollably feeling my teeth rattle, staring blindly ahead of me.

A deep rumble filled the prison walls once again shattering the silence . As if hearing my shout of despair God himself came rushing across the wall in a swirling wave of light. All I could do was stare at the hole in front of me. I saw nothing. A blinding flash filled the prison once more than darkness consumed my vision. When I opened my eyes I saw the floor directly below me and a voice roaring ""WHY?!?! WHAT THE FUCK!!""

","""The warden is in trouble again.""

One man had asked that question when I first stepped into cellblock K. 

He was a large, stocky fella and probably wouldn't have lasted five minutes outside without help from his muscular arms but there he was staring at me like some kind of bird caught in a tree. He just blinked, I guess expecting an answer but all that came out was another blink. His muscles began to flex as he waited for my response which would soon come.

""I don't know why it's on your conscience but the warden always acts up when you go on break."" Another inmate piped in with no interest or amusement for him in the slightest bit. This one seemed like another guy you might meet in prison who doesn't want to end up dead before too long. He was skinny though so he probably survived pretty well most days thanks to his metabolism burning through all the calories he ate and threw away in less than a day. Like a human garbage disposal this time of year they all seemed to love summer because their food intake matched up with how much sun and how little exercise they felt like doing when the temperatures climbed high enough to roast anyone under an overcast sky. There were people walking around these walls, both prisoners and guards, who looked perfectly healthy and fit despite not moving half-ass at all during the hot months because of a lack of natural sunlight or motivation to get out and about.  Prisoners didn't seem to care either way unless they hadn't seen the sunshine in too long or some other excuse popped into their heads to escape from the heat for a few minutes, which in most cases ended up being the same reason since sunlight wasn't a good cure to having the flu coming back even stronger than before.

A voice from behind them called out ""Hey what happened?"" The skinny one didn't turn around, he kept watching while simultaneously chewing on something in his hand like it was some piece of bread or gum and ignoring everything else in the area except this strange prisoner who sat down in front of the window and started talking. It could be easily interpreted that this man wanted to make sure that he wasn't bothering anyone by looking like he wanted to watch people going by which wasn't really anything unusual since most folks in our building did that all the time whether they watched real people walking across the street by us or people coming over the wall or whatever happened to fall over here. 

Another voice snapped ""Well if that doesn't concern someone I don't know what will"". Now the guy was finally facing forward and turning slightly in order to meet my eyes. A lot of prisoners stared at me that way when they heard something was wrong - a general disregard followed by curiosity as to what may actually go on inside of any given frame. In jail there weren't many rules anymore, once you broke one more you went straight to solitary which in itself didn't sound that bad unless you managed to break two or three at once because then I doubt they let you return until the governor approved your reentry after you served three months - six if the judge ruled so and we knew better than to disagree with the justice system (because fuck yeah you do)

Another inmate added fuel onto the fire with a grin plastered across his face ""What the hell is goin on?"". Yeah he still couldn't stop himself from grinning. This guy liked the idea of jail as much as most inmates seem to enjoy the comfort and safety of knowing where the next meal and place to sleep would be provided as opposed to wandering and scavenging in society. I suppose prison isn't like being home but it's close enough that most guys choose to play dumb if they have nothing better to do. It seems logical that a prisoner would only be able to appreciate prison as much as those living conditions allow them which are obviously worse compared to normal life. And most prisoners can hardly notice the difference so why bother thinking about it? Not me though, I'd rather spend several hours every night reading books sitting in the library than playing games or doing stupid things like trying to smoke weed, although there is some sort of drug program over here now and I think smoking pot may be okay if its for medicinal purposes but I haven't heard a lawyer claim there's any actual drugs in here at the moment. Just prescription medications dispensed to prisoners. Which means that there isn't drugs in the pharmacy but that does mean there must be some somewhere within the prison somehow. Maybe there's even a local dealer. That sounded kind of sketchy for me at least, I decided against doing some research because who wants to learn of such shady ways in this prison anyway? Some stuff just ain't worth exploring, especially since the law usually keeps track of who did what. And speaking of that I see the warden is acting up again. Shit happens, never mind. What should I do to calm this big fuckface down? Maybe lock him away again? Lock a whole new cell block away! Let the poor guy die alone with his own thoughts...Nah, it won't do any good if i keep locking him up forever. How about giving him a small talk? Might change how he feels! Or am i mistaken, he probably doesn't really wanna hear my opinion anyway. Oh god please God help us all. Here comes that look, the glazed over pupils and that vacant smile that seems to follow you wherever you go, as he waits for me to do what any self respecting immortal would do at that point, roll my eyes and walk over to give him a lecture on morality or religion or politics or whatever fucked up shit was on his mind today. What could possibly go wrong?!

I wonder if he'll ever come along someday and leave everyone wondering what they missed...

","It was 239 years ago that mankind first came into contact with alien races and other worlds. It had changed human history forever; our planet turned green and gold, as the colors of every other world started emitting different colored rays across the spectrum: The North America Galaxy (a light blue), Northern Hemisphere Earth (an ice white), Southern Hemisphere Earth (a deep brown). However some planets were just dark black/black hole shades for lack of color or unknown reason. Those were the most popular destinations for scientists and explorers. For millions upon billions of years they’d been learning from each other and sharing knowledge but always under the supervision of governments back home. They would never travel alone on an independent journey because no one would be sure if there is another space-faring species out there watching them in some unseen way, so it had to be done through groups.

When we took over the Mars colony for our own use all of us humans knew what was about to occur when we met the aliens called the Drakkons. Humans knew that everything about them was bad: they loved warfare and bloodshed which made the colonists want nothing more than to take over Mars but not many wanted to die by fighting them. So they sent out fleets instead of soldiers and quickly realized their mistake by destroying their own colonies. With technology superior enough to control and convert any hostile starships but still only strong enough to conquer one enemy planet, our fleet landed and used its vast amounts of anti-matter lasers against the Dragon ships until only scrap metal remained, leaving only small groups surviving in large spaceships hidden among the wreckage before sending a call back to Earth asking humanity to take over the planet for themselves.

","There were seven, including you, and then there were six when one of them died. When that one came back to life it was clear he had been poisoned. Now there were five...and then two when another one went crazy in rage. And now there are three.

“I saw him,” said Michael, his voice low. “He’s coming for us.” 

John blinked at him slowly. “Why?”

Michael pointed his gun toward a darkened corridor between the living quarters. “I don’t know.” He lowered his voice. “It doesn’t look like any man I know…” His eyes widened as he whispered again. “...not yet. I hope this will help.” Michael waved something with his hands. Three other men walked into view, but they looked familiar. Almost too familiar. “I can smell him” hissed Thomas, pointing his face toward the hallway. “Is he really alive?” asked Tom from behind Michael. They all began to whisper among themselves, afraid to raise their voices above normal conversational levels. It did little good to try and hide themselves in their bunker, especially while someone was trying to track them down inside.

John nodded slightly, and gave the order, ""Stay calm everyone."" The lights flickered wildly once more; John felt a pang of pain run through him in the exact spot where the bullets hit last night. Suddenly an echo of a scream rang out through the dark halls - *Help!* A burst of gunfire echoed off the metal walls, and in front of them, a body slammed against the steel doors they all hid behind. The first human to appear was the man on the radio who kept talking about the poison, though it never worked properly. What happened then could be considered nothing less than horrifying. He wasn't sick or hurt at all, which confused several people who knew of him. Why had his voice become so raspy and shaky?

Thomas jumped up and shouted, ""What is going on here?!"" But none could answer, because instead they were watching Thomas leap through the vents and onto the conveyor belt moving food to the kitchen; not to talk, but to get into a room with nobody else being allowed inside, without keys. John couldn't stop the question that popped into his head; how could he do that? But even asking made his arms tingle again as if an ice cold nail scraped each one until they dropped. Then the door opened. Another bullet ripped through John's flesh, making him slump to the floor dead. ""Damn,"" muttered Michael, his gun falling from his hand. The rest watched as John crumpled beside Michael. They waited patiently, waiting for whoever was still outside to come in, but none ever entered. It was only later, however, when they noticed that everyone had gone outside when they started hearing things rustling through ventilation shafts. Michael turned towards John's lifeless form. Something glistened under the dim light shining from afar; the bullet holes lit up with a silvery glow. All around them lay bodies. But not all of them human. This new foe, much more cunning than John had thought, knew exactly what weapons he possessed, and was able to use those same weapons against him! Or did it...? They hadn't heard the rustle for almost twenty hours by the time they discovered what awaited them on the second floor; another weapon-wielding assailant hiding amongst them.... a woman. As always she smiled sweetly and gave a friendly wave.

","The two screens flickered and hissed as the lights dimmed around us; one panel on each side, displaying an array of binary code. We had been in this stasis pod for forty years before it was finally released.

""What... the hell happened?""  A tall woman in a grey uniform looked at me nervously. I didn't know if it was more concerning she was staring at my chest or her mouth gaping wide in shock because of what lay beyond our windows. The view screen faded from darkness into a bright green that lit up the entire cockpit for a few seconds, then went back to black once again. 

""I don't know. There is just... *something* here..."" Another man stepped closer with his binoculars. ""Damn. It looks like we are floating about two thousand miles off Earth!"" He exclaimed, and pointed toward a shimmering ball of purple dust.   

There were five other astronauts around him: three men and two women, all slightly older than me and myself. They wore suits similar to Captain Lee's but some sort of space-uniform with strange logos imprinted onto them. Their faces were white and grayed and they were shaking. Everyone else in the room seemed terrified. But I felt something different: curiosity. A thirst for knowledge. Something drove these people. Why was everyone freaking out? What do they see down there?   

Captain Lee stared through the glass with narrowed eyes. We couldn't talk yet; they locked our heads over on the second control desk while we stood still, frozen. Finally he spoke: ""This is Commander Reed speaking, Houston wants us to land ASAP."" His voice sounded strained by fatigue, exhaustion and maybe also fear. But the question on most of the screens changed abruptly:   

""Why are we landing?!""    

---   

It wasn't until after we landed I found out how to explain the situation to those aboard, though only one of our six astronauts understood exactly why the others had such a negative reaction. I thought maybe I did too but I figured that the other half would have noticed immediately when I tried to explain.

","""Please come with me."" He stared into my eyes, and held out his hand for mine to shake. His hands looked much the same as all the other crewman on this ship: strong build, tanned faces, rugged hands and short hair that was neatly combed. I took it, just shook briefly, then met his gaze again. ""Come here kid,"" he said. We did what we were told in training: got up, walked right over him, and let our bodies hang off to the side. 

He didn't seem too happy about it at first, but eventually smiled and went back to speaking.  ""...the rest of us will hold you down to the floor so you can't run away!""   I grinned, knowing they wouldn't have been able to do it anyway. The whole time I knew they weren't going to make a move on me, not when we had seen their intentions in advance. This is what happened:  as soon as they thought the pilot had left the room, one or two would make a beeline for me...to make sure it wasn't an accident. After the first few attempts to take advantage of me, which all failed, those who couldn't bring themselves to kill anyone anymore started using tricks: spitting some random saliva towards me at odd angles, kicking sandbags over their shoulders as they ran back to the cockpit (making them sweat) as if their own weight hadn't killed them already, or trying to trip me by putting debris in my path without warning! In a small way, they hoped they would succeed in killing me before I could use what knowledge they wanted from me...which I had no intention of providing. But none of these actions worked either! When I gave away any hints, they saw it coming a mile away and would change strategies accordingly...or, when we entered a tight space they tried something completely unanticipated and even more fatal! It would only work once, though, as there was no telling how I would react; if they failed I would quickly turn it around, making good use of any knowledge acquired in the meantime - it would give me enough leverage to kill them regardless. 

So far it had gone quite badly:  a crew member got a hole through their abdomen because they pulled out their plasma cutter while still wearing its holster inside pocket, another got electrocuted from a solar panel whilst tripping over me! I don't know the current state of the ship's ventilation, but it has probably gotten a lot worse since I set foot on board. 

Their plan changed on Monday. All five men sat down at the table for breakfast, all in positions as comfortable as possible to avoid injury or death during the briefing later. One man opened the hatch and spoke ""This mission sucks; it seems our last attempt to escape caused some damage to the engine rooms"". Another replied, seemingly pleased; ""oh yeah? So now we are going to have to dock and get repairs fixed?"" And, finally, the first man looked at the second guy and replied ""Don't you dare fucking say anything about repairs!"". That seemed to upset the third man; ""that wasn't necessary; this isn't your personal relationship with anyone on this ship!"". The fourth responded; ""yeah, maybe I should tell everyone if it is indeed your personal relationship?"". The fifth added to the conversation as well ""can we please talk about the fact you were sleeping with each others wives?""; the fourth man replied ""no!""; and the second reacted angrily.

The tension was broken when the hatch opened, a man with red facial scarring stepped inside. The fifth man put down his empty cup, picked up an apple and tossed it into the air like he hadn't been alive until a moment ago: he ate the apple straight up and said nothing. The other members joined in throwing apples; however, they missed their target. No-one was hurt; instead someone kicked the nearest chair under himself, cracking bones across his body; most of the passengers were injured somehow. Then, the man with red face jumped out of the window and fell from several hundred meters. The remaining four managed to grab hold of each other and slowly climbed to safety; shortly thereafter, they decided the situation seemed best dealt with outside.


All of them agreed they needed to leave immediately, but had no idea where to go! As usual. Everyone stood up and began wandering out the door, looking everywhere. None of them made it out of the corridors. They had locked themselves in the main engine room, and apparently forgot where the docking port was located!

Then the ship landed hard, the emergency lights went off and everyone was thrown off their feet like rag dolls. 

Afterward I waited for the order to fire the missile and destroyed the fuel lines and rockets.

","I watched with narrowed eyes as the other boy took his seat. ""You will stand trial by magic, for the death of your brother."" I said, stepping back so that he could have space. The man who had killed my brother looked at me.

""Do you understand what I am doing?"" I asked him, staring back at the old woman in front of us. 

He nodded slowly. She then smiled and held out a white wand. ""Very well,"" she replied, turning towards the young man who was being led to the throne before us.  We waited while she chanted, until suddenly, it stopped and her voice was no longer deep but clear, loud and ringing throughout the large chamber. 

""Tell me something true about yourself."" she commanded. The boy was silent, seemingly afraid or confused but unable to speak as if something was choking him from his throat. He started shaking then, tears running down his cheeks. Then a stream of incoherent gibberish ran forth in English as fast as human speech allows yet still too slow for anyone to decipher properly except those we already knew. We all understood perfectly. That is why this old woman told the old king of the nation we were trapped in that 'a lot would come forth once the spell was broken'. They didn't know it involved half our lives now. 

""This one tells nothing true"", she muttered in disgust. Her hand moved and a long string wound itself around the head of the boy like thread wrapped around some sort of rope and tugged him toward me. ""Well done"", said the old woman. The king sat up next to me. I nodded at him. For years we had been struggling through the country we lived in since the last emperor disappeared two hundred years ago, having never seen another human ruler again.  Finally someone showed themselves with a story and the king decided this was good enough for him. But nobody had ever written their stories in a language we would understand or any other language except this one.

There was only one rule: write your story every day. And always tell the truth within your story, regardless how little or unimportant it seemed. Otherwise, when they take away the pen you die. It sounded simple enough until our turn came round and we were forced to start telling everything we thought of. Or did not think of since the moment I learned that writing makes words appear even if no mind has given instructions as such to do so; they appeared because words exist everywhere. Thus the word 'you' had appeared in my own sentence without my will. My entire existence seems to be made up of these things - just as a word appears at random without instruction. Every time the old woman spoke, something new must be added, and it happens faster than the eye can track with each passing second. Some people don't notice the strange, chaotic flow of events occurring while others experience it fully. We all learn soon enough whether we belong among them. In my case, it happened very quickly, though I do not remember exactly when I realized it began. Everything we read, heard or saw was somehow connected, and the connection grows stronger over time as I recall events from my past through a veil of muddled memories. Once again my thoughts jump between various locations within the room and between multiple timelines simultaneously before landing firmly upon the first story being told to me by the witch.

The other men have also noticed that everything connects. There seem to be more of these things happening as days pass. If they keep going like this, there won't be anything left for us to think of. No matter how many times we try to block it out, thoughts like ""why did that happen? Why does nothing feel real anymore? What if there's nothing but random, meaningless strings connecting everything in the universe?"", continue to pop into our heads as often as the previous questions we ask ourselves. Eventually, most become incapable of thinking straight.

Thus, we wait for the queen's decree to lift, hoping it means whatever it is she says will eventually end. It may happen today or it may occur tomorrow. Until then, the only choice we have is to wait anxiously.

I never understood what was going on around me - everyone is too quick to say it. But his final words were always ringing in my ears, and I never forgot. They didn't tell me anything about it until years later when we discovered it all happened through some weird time-loop - that he had died 79 times before he actually died the last one, only for it not to count. This loop continued for weeks and week until one day they found out that this place called Athera could be reached only by those who can die over and over again - that some people in another realm exist here with no memory, but just enough knowledge of how to survive life once more without ever getting bored or tired of living again.

","The bell tower was nearly as old as the town itself, having been struck twice by lightning in its lifetime, both times resulting in the complete reconstruction of the whole structure. At night time, when it illuminated the entire square in its warm glow, it seemed like a beacon for all people of light and virtue. In contrast, at midday it appeared to be a giant eye looking down upon people who committed acts of darkness and sin.

In those that did not believe their fates were predetermined, or who saw themselves as superior gods, The Bell Tower looked over their lives and tried to steer them towards being reborn. That is, the tower wanted no one dead; but rather it preferred that they simply live an honest and productive life that would see them rewarded in the afterlife.  For everyone else the Bells call out loud, ""Death, damnation, hellfire..."" but occasionally you could also hear someone crying in between, if they had chosen wrongly (as in going against the Bell Towers advice), or perhaps just because of some personal tragedy. 


Once a quarter cycle from every century, each person has to go up into the belfry where one holds a prayer session with all their sins laid bare before a large gilded mirror. There should be no hesitation in confessing any wrong-doing, the sins can be judged fairly by those present so long as they have evidence: the ringers judge solely by what actually happened. If there is nothing, the judges will tell you straight away which sins haven t occurred and how you can avoid committing them. Should there remain doubt, then these judgements may differ according to those observing your prayers. A number of different Judges decide whether they think you should live, die, or serve punishment. Their decision is final and unchangeable, whatever you do during your time up in the Belfry they will still condemn you. But fear does not set in until after judgment - after this, a series of events may result in either an even further judgement or a death sentence.


There are quite a few different kinds of Judge (most only take one area into account). For example, a Judge may listen for misdemeanours such as stealing money and lying etc. He may have an assistant Judge look for a lack of morality or honesty, or others for their own particular sins (murderer? Theft? Sinner of a different type?)

While you re up there, you should try to repent, as God watches and knows exactly what happened to you! He knows everything about us anyway. So why bother saying anything more than confession? What is better - truth or lies? Only Time will Tell...


Afterward, one enters the prison cell where he waits for his fate to be carried out. Upon getting sentenced the warden will escort you to the entrance via dungeon stairs. Once you get past the two locked doors (the door into the prison yard and the exit) you should pray to your Lord. You should also pray hard because soon enough you won t be able to ask him for help any longer. In the other direction, once again facing the opposite way of the prisoners, will be one last opportunity to walk under the watchful eye of the city bell. This is probably best avoided.
The Warden will return and shout ""Prison."" Upon hearing this words say nothing. Go into your cell immediately and await your sentence of imprisonment, eternal damnation, or whatever misfortune Fate has decreed for you. Onwards to Hell!!

Onwards to the gate!! Be gone sinner!!!

The bells chime three times in a row. It's clear now: This little man was condemned by God!

One year later the bell rings again. Well, I guess we're doomed. As much as we deserve it: No amount of praying made any difference.

No!

But I didn't expect my fellow prisoner, who had the very same face as me, to be standing in front of him. We've been here for several years now, never meeting or talking, never seeing each other's eyes meet. Now, as the prison warden leads us into the inner hall, he turns around to tell me ""It's all over."" I turn around and smile at my fellow prisoner, and he smiles back. They lead us through the arched doorway, passing the guard, and as I pass him I speak plainly for all to hear: ""It seems we've finally been spared,"" The guards let out a harsh roar. I don't move. My jaw hangs slack as I stare forward. One of the guards reaches into his pocket and pulls out my bible and throws it onto the ground, picks up a rock and throws it at my head as I fall to my knees with no effort, I grab my chest and clutch my heart as blood gushes forth. He lets another one loose into the center of my skull, knocking my body unconscious.


I open my eyes slowly to find myself staring at the smiling face of the warden. The guards let me up, shove me into a truck to travel the miles north-east, the faces of my wife and daughter fill the window, and off we go.

","My wife said I shouldn’t be scared of dying, that fear just delays the inevitable in itself. Now staring at the burning ball against the black fabric of space, I suppose she could be right. Still, it doesn’t make me feel any better. Not with it eating us slowly over billions of years, one sun-ray after another until even we become dust within its blazing fire-storm…

It always comes with this irony… The moment you cease living your last, longest breath, the whole universe goes dim—or does it? If your mortality was a thing so unique to yourself—and mine is to all others too—so then wouldn't time itself die along with me... would there not be some other form to time for someone else or something more important, but no! Time didn’t stop—we were simply waiting for it. An infinite set of people waiting together as we knew nothing yet, not knowing anyone or anything outside of ourselves... how strange is that?! It’s hard to grasp what my mind was before and to imagine what will it be now. Maybe a simple life-form will see something out there... a different species. One day they may discover humans—they are quite similar after all—but in such ways that haven’t been foreseen even by humans.

Maybe those beings are already here, exploring our little blue planet as a new frontier. I hope God blesses them enough to never find what is hidden between me and my wife, if only for my sanity’s sake... because soon enough he will. 

I won’t deny it—it makes death less frightening—after all where did all these emotions come from? All of these feelings we experience so strongly when we fall in love, grieve & so on…? We don’t fully comprehend why humans behave certain ways despite all logic telling them otherwise; it all boils down to human psychology... And who am I to judge humanity once again for not following their own nature. But perhaps I was wrong to feel disappointed by the fact that I know exactly how every single human feels and acts, that emotion being my sole reason to exist. No wonder I’ve lived for so long—because I had already experienced every possible combination of reactions to existence first hand! Sure I might grow old quickly now, but that’s the price for knowing everything for eternity. At least the pain is short-lived. Some say they died slow deaths, and lived for many centuries... but it wasn’t really ‘their’ lives. More accurately it was my life, extended into many centuries. The longer I lived, the more aware I became—and yet still they never understood... Oh well.

As the light intensified further I found myself feeling sadder than ever before.... This is not ending well is it...? No way can’t you feel me growing weaker?? What kind of cruel trick is this? It appears that I’m losing power by experiencing each new aspect of existence: joy, sadness, sorrow, pleasure... and most importantly love. When I reach true understanding & finally overcome my mortal fear of death, I know it is a sign—no matter how I wish it wasn’t true—that I need to leave. So that’s what I shall do—enjoy every second of each interaction until I meet up with my soulmate one day. My greatest fear is never finding the person I want in this lifetime, if I am truly destined to live for billions of years—that fear is all too real, considering everything else around me dies off so easily. I guess now I know. For everyone else watching, enjoy yourselves while you can & please go ahead and tell your children about the great King Elizabeth the wise, a woman that taught both men and women to value life, & helped mankind through the golden age that followed. May you all remember and learn from the errors of our mistakes while our time is still good, as we surely will run out of it very soon indeed.

The king was confused. ""Well, I would of thought so,"" he replied. 

""No. The thing that killed my soul was actually an angel who looked exactly like a man with blonde hair."" She went on to explain how she had been betrayed by someone whom she thought she could trust.

","I am old... but I did not mean to be so old..  You may think that being king for 1300+ years means one would know the feeling of getting old... You are wrong. To actually *be* old is something else entirely. You feel your bones grow brittle with age.... They hurt when you turn over in bed in the night; Your joints crackle as your ligaments give out from constant wear-and-tear. Your muscles weaken; you can no longer pick up heavy things ... Or walk without pain. The aches become unbearable even after years on a throne as powerful as the British crown .... Even while sitting down in my seat i must rest my hand upon the cushion to take its weight. The more I do this, the less stable I become ... And eventually I fail completely..... My body simply collapses under my own weight.   


And then there's the mind.... A life of watching kingdoms rise and fall .... That makes your brain weary too; But unlike your body, that weariness does not show. No wrinkles or cracks appear on your face .... The aging process continues in your brain like it does everywhere else, except now that process turns into something entirely different... Instead of becoming weaker it becomes stronger; Your knowledge increases; you learn how best to govern your people and expand your power without making enemies among them. You grow more patient than ever; The human ability of fear no longer holds any effect on you, though still exists as a concept ... One day I realised this: An ancient god had given me this chance. For what reason? I didn't see that at first but some time later a wise man approached me to tell me why he was chosen as such... He told me that he would be allowed to rule with absolute power until his death. That in case he failed, only he would be allowed to die (for if no human could rule his successor'd never get around to ruling) thus preventing the collapse of civilization. He explained that he would gain all the wisdom of humans in the world, all at once, which he claimed was what saved him from turning cruel and tyrannical before being made ruler of Man ... In short he was the ""Wise King""...

Now you ask why my soul isn't tired anymore: It's not just because I have nothing to watch anymore; It's because I'm dead and it's been five seconds since someone decided to kill me .

So let me explain *how* they killed me: Two soldiers walked through the doors of Buckingham Palace one morning & asked for my assitance.. They took their guns inside and fired two shots . At that point every citizen stopped what they were doing & looked towards the palace to watch.. Nobody knew what had happened as they hadn't seen such a sight . Two soldiers, two gunshot wounds , one king of England laid on the floor, gasping for breath

""Get to me mum!"" cried a voice as a man lay beside the corpses, holding onto his wounded son. This was the Prince Philip who had grown old & feeble. ""Help him Mum,"" said another boy ""Please help my little brother."" Another child ran to pull his bleeding brothers arm. Some others helped lift the other royal family members off the ground, placing them to recover quickly & inconspicuously amongst the cheering of civilians . Only the queen stood staring into the direction of the gunshots where one red stain bloomed from the royal assassin's hands. She ran over to the queen's children & saw their faces as red stained by grief, she knew. They wouldn't make it.




The queen fainted.



A month later, a frail young girl named Anne Elizabeth died due to loss of oxygen when she choked on vomit. Her sister the same name as her mother followed soon after, unable to keep breathing whilst crying over her deceased sibling. They were both very strong in the ways that none dared to admit to: They didn't give up easily; they survived countless near-death experiences - accidents on trips abroad, car crashes during childhood, severe cases of Malaria and Dysentery. And yet, these tragedies proved fatal because they occurred on birthdays.

","""There's no need for tears, my dear,"" she remarked, patting her headrest gently. ""In your time with me, we've lived such long, joyous lives.""

But when I looked back at her, all that came to mind was the immense sorrow that had filled our world in the past seven and a half centuries.  Her husband had died on his 15th birthday, after a brief illness. Then my mother took over as Queen, but she was also taken from us by pneumonia just three months into taking the throne. Her daughter then took over from my mother. And after almost eight decades of having to take a step aside because of this illness, she then passed away peacefully in my 14th year old.

I wasn't too fond of the idea of my being a queen until they brought out their grand baby carriage to bring me to court for introductions. I didn't mind much though: As a child it was so much fun to be paraded around. After I turned 12 however, I was less thrilled about the whole affair. I didn't want to be confined to such a palace as a teenager and decided that if I ever got close enough to the age where I could do whatever I damn well pleased with the crown, than I wouldn't let them shove their grand chariots down my throat again. A decision that would see me go quite mad in rebellion. But eventually, even I grew weary of fighting against everyone and every single thing, and allowed the life to slowly slip through my fingers. However, what did I get? Nothing except for some useless title, and absolutely NO POWER AT ALL! Even after centuries later, it doesn't make sense why that happened...

","""Reparations.""

The head of the Reparations committee, dressed in an absurdly oversized coat, looked at me and tapped a pen on his desk as if I had just finished telling him the answer to World War III strategy. The weight of my small country seemed so significant in that office, in my meeting room. The chair was not too comfortable, but that was no matter. Everything else around me felt uncomfortable because it wasn't meant for me. It was everything I could have ever wished for. All those things I wanted when I was five years old - now here they were. A large conference table that smelled like new money. Several people who seemed nice and friendly. And an idea waiting to be told: ""You want land? You can have what you want. Why wouldn't we give it to you?""

My name is Thomas and I am nineteen. I recently moved from America. I went home to the hospital the other day after failing out of school, and I found myself talking to a pretty girl about how much she liked living in France. She said something along the lines of ""I love Paris, but my father says there isn't any way he will move us back to France once he retires next year."" I never spoke French. In fact, neither did I speak one word of modern Romance languages or German or Italian. The only thing I knew was English. That is why Germany wanted to let us merge their states into ours.

So then I took some time by myself. Thinking where would I rather live. Then I thought of America since everyone likes it and I didn't know French, nor did I think German really fit. As soon as my mind reached Europe, I had made my decision: Versailles. I mean, you can't expect a big old boy who has lived half his life watching American baseball games every day to spend all of his summer vacations going to Disneyworld and making friends with foreign diplomats. Who knows though!

""Who are you?"", The woman answers back, not quite knowing what to do. She was never used to talking to someone before her first meeting... but then again she had just walked into a room filled with five different soldiers and she knew that she didn't know any of them, she looked around for a familiar face, something other than a stranger looking back at her. There were three generals there: one older than the last, another middle aged as well as a young lad, his eyes wide and full of fear. But they all had this single thing in common. They all had eyes filled with sadness and defeat.

","""A little light reading for the children."" The woman said, gesturing towards her book of fairy tales which she was holding in one hand and an apple pie that looked suspiciously like it would fall apart if moved further than five centimetres from her plate on the table.

She sat down at an empty table nearby and pointed at the boy sitting next to her child. She had not thought about how many other people were attending this evening's meeting since most of them must have been sent by the government - especially since she had arrived so early just to get a seat before someone beat her there. It had worked as well though: now everyone seemed content to let the man with the beard occupy himself while waiting for him. After all he did tell them what should be expected by law after his arrival. But still... she had taken only the seat closest to the exit hoping to sneak out quickly after he finished speaking.

She watched him look over her name in disgust, but when he turned around it was already too late. He slammed the door to the building shut behind him and hurried off into the night. He had done exactly what he had told them he would do and the woman felt a spark of hope rise up inside of her; perhaps Gervonia could finally become real! She wanted to scream aloud, run to her husband who had gotten ready for work too fast today and leave him, or cry for her kids. Her husband wouldn't care either way since he would never understand why they needed to talk about such a thing. All of these thoughts clouded her mind as she stared ahead at her neighbour picking apples for an imaginary picnic, oblivious to the turmoil going through the young mother's brain. The sound of footsteps coming closer alerted her that it wasn't her neighbor who was walking towards her. When her attacker reached their table they began to rant about how she could use the same tactics as this stranger but instead used 'love' to gain sympathy, and make others more likely to help them. She glared at them, but didn't try to argue with him anymore. They knew everything she wished to say and no amount of arguing would change anyone's mind anyway.

","""A sovereign state that makes no claims on other nations' countries?"" The man sighed deeply, leaning back and throwing his hands in defeat ""I will not continue this conversation.""

""Good grief,"" I said, slamming my fist onto the table, momentarily startled by how hard it felt as though an invisible creature were sitting at the opposite end of the room, ""Then there's nothing more we can do about it."" I stood up abruptly from my seat, shaking some loose strands of hair back in my forehead with every step. My anger had been bubbling over for weeks now, finally boiling over when the Versailles delegation had scoffed at my claim, then tried to deny my existence, their words dripping with contempt. How dare they look down upon me so? I was simply claiming what was rightfully mine; all I did was go around collecting information about countries who claimed rights over regions far greater than those belonging to me. And here I was, standing before them, powerless. But something snapped within me at the moment he told me their response, forcing myself to confront him once more. They had heard of me from everyone: my ancestors, neighbors in different cities where I ran afoul of various officials during my travels, even royalty! Most would laugh off my claim, but I wasn't like others; I believed.

I took a deep breath before taking my own position, sitting squarely in front of the chair behind which the man sat.  It would have made sense if I hadn't seen him yesterday while looking over maps, but now he suddenly appeared to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time, always present, but never actually there. It would be difficult for anyone outside this meeting room to explain what I saw; after all, who would believe me anyway? A talking animal with a crown perched precariously on its head offering treaties and counter-treaties on behalf of a long extinct nation? Still, I couldn't bear the thought of them denying my request and watching me leave empty handed, despite all the work I did preparing for this very summit.

""There is one thing left to ask,"" I said softly, ""How exactly should I begin to collect the amount owed to me?"" The man smiled sadly and nodded in agreement. He knew well enough that asking such an unusual question could shatter our deal, or make us both turn tail right away. Instead, he agreed to let me figure out how to manage this debt from scratch, although only one person seemed willing to accept my proposition thus far. There was still hope yet, though; perhaps one day soon there would be someone else who'd agree too. Or maybe instead, a friend would come along to hear my story, one who'd be convinced by the sheer force of my personality, rather than by facts and figures.

If you look real hard enough, you can see them too:  ghosts who still haunt the earth but are able to do so as they please.

It wasn’t any easier when we were young because that girl was all the other guys looked at once upon hearing rumors that I was gone. When people die, their bodies decompose in about 3 days if they aren’t kept in some type of sterile container. She could tell from the smell of my coat on our wedding day…I think. In order to give everyone a chance that they’d need a little more time before they died I took a few weeks off work in my early career and came down to her city to talk to all the potential brides or groom to be grooms until I found someone worthy enough to take my hand again. And yes I took “taking my hand” literally since they had never seen a ghost and I decided to put on a pair of worn gloves and go through all the motions they wanted during a wedding ceremony.

His eyes met mine and an expression of confusion, fear even, flickered across his granite features before solidifying into something close to… contentment. 

“Oh my god,” I thought, “How cool is it he’s actually been here all along”. There was not one person who had not heard stories about him, even in the slums.

From atop his throne I surveyed the scene.  A lone figure stood with legs crossed and feet planted firmly on top of an open casket full of what looked to be some kind of...meat grinder? My brain couldn't quite grasp why they were here or how it made sense for my side to have lost. In one corner was a pair of skeletons tossing skulls back and forth in conversation - perhaps they were friends who had managed to make it into the afterlife. 

I smiled, though it came out more like a growl ""No matter how many times it happens agains me its no good. The odds are always against us"" I continued walking towards him. He reached forward and laid a single hand, covered in blue goo over the pit where he once had hands. It was disgusting looking and he needed clean hands in order to carry out his plan, which could have been just killing me with his mind.

The villain sat there, waiting for me to move. Eventually I did - I grabbed a pile of bones scattered amongst the corpses of humans and tossed them in his direction. His eyes bulged and his face contorted into a mask of pure rage, he lunged toward the mess but stopped short of touching any of it due to something holding him still. This seemed odd to me, when he wanted something he always got it. Maybe it wasn't so unusual to be repulsed by such vile thing, but none the less it held him back. But not enough to keep him contained ""Oh great! You think now you can distract me. Its not funny anymore"" he cried ""Why do you torture yourself! Kill him!"" 

His face turned red and he lunged at the bones, all I saw was a flash of blue then he fell with a thump onto the ground. I felt a small tickle behind my ear and opened up to see the skull and the teeth and jaws of what appeared to be an alligator and let a few flies come loose before I tossed the remains aside. A sigh escaped my lips.


He didn't seem to notice my antics and kept throwing around body parts. When the last of the meat went flying across the area he slumped to his knees and stared at the blood streaming out his mouth. Then, finally he relaxed his grip on his sword and closed his eyes.

“You wish to know what happened,” the voice of the fallen said. In many a tale have such words spoken. All are made better than any truth could ever be. But here is where they are least believable: a lone hero stands amongst the ruins of his world. 

He coughed out the next word from whatever remained of lungs: ”I knew what would happen - “ The fallen was silent before speaking again.  It took no time, I could not hear more then one or two seconds pass between sentences. “ I was aware - “ Another sentence came. This would have been hard, after death and near-death experiences you would think someone else would feel different - ""I knew if I wanted to destroy this world...the universe too...it would take something greater than a mere sword or even an axe.. something that matched mine own power."" My heart skipped to my stomach and I saw that the King had never moved. Neither did his eyes, nor his tongue. He spoke with nothing but thought. 

And thus, it should only be logical to assume: *I knew* - and yet he lived long after destroying everything else I knew. We both must have guessed it on the fly - though perhaps the King understood while I did not. Perhaps he needed to understand this for later, I do not know for sure either way. Anyway, that meant one thing: He was still alive. If he wasn’t...what would be left of the universe? Only ruin! No more heroes, no more villains, just… nothing! What would remain of anything after all living things were gone? Just dust itself...and the stars. And the sun. Well...no matter. Let's get back to the topic at hand. He survived after saving the world, he saved himself. What can he have done? Is he happy about it? How did he come to exist before the fall and how has he come since? Whatever was going to be asked will be answered soon enough, we won’t keep each other waiting, shall we?

174,"The Villain stares down at you from his throne. “Know this, hero. I may play a king, but I am as much a prisoner as those in the dungeons below.”
","“You have won me over with your pleas for mercy” the King said, “and because you speak truly, and honestly,” He turned to look at the guards behind him, he motioned with an elaborate gesture of the hand “kill him!” His soldiers obeyed not without first dropping their arms at his feet and walking straight in front of him. With each step forward they spoke so fast that all you could make out were vague words like: ‘freedom’, ‘justice’ ,  ‘love’, and ‘life’.

They stopped just before one another began to push forward with force. Then the King stepped on both of them! As quickly as he did, however, both fell away to the other side. The last thing he heard was the guards shouting: 

“It is now up to you young man!” From where he stood, he saw that it was also up to him to go, or kill them all again. They didn’t stop shouting; every single soldier repeated each sentence more than twice, sometimes adding to it themselves with extra sentences about what free will means; freedom of choice; free will to decide how many words are going to be spoken, how many sentences; and to which audience one would give them...

And with these reasons the two armies engaged each other into battle and a great war broke out which lasted for several days. During the last day, after thousands had been killed, the King came across some woods and decided to rest there under the shade of a big tree. When he opened his eyes, he suddenly discovered that nobody remained within sight of him. So he walked for miles until he found himself lying before a castle with beautiful gardens that stretched far off in the distance, full of birds chirping the most delightful tunes. Looking through one of the windows he spotted someone sitting inside in full armour, drinking wine while watching television and listening intently at something very loud coming out of its ear. In short, it looked as if the owner of this castle was absolutely exhausted. And yet the sounds emanating from him sounded like “hero”! And here lived the Hero who captured millions! But what exactly would the hero do? Go fight him again? No - it wouldn't work - surely by now they’ve lost faith in him. Or leave him alone? No. It’s better that way anyway.

After spending several days talking to the man in the castle, the King came upon the surprising conclusion that his adversary was no human being, and neither beast. If he hadn’t seen the TV screen the King would have assumed the creature wasn’t human either, when he got closer but realised immediately that the room next to the livingroom contained a small crib nearby, the name ""Alex"" printed underneath. Only then did the real truth dawn onto him, he was dealing with nothing less than the Antichrist. The irony, he thought: the guy can only watch TV during the night! That's right that's it. Not even God has interfered enough in his life to defeat me, let alone some wretched creature he spawned with all this technology. You can tell by how weak he seems he hasn’t learnt everything that humanity knows yet, since he can still be defeated.

The response wasn't one that took me much by surprise: *It appears you broke a command module.* 

I laughed and gave my dog an ear scratch *Don't worry, I wouldn't do anything so reckless*

""We just sent back three separate warnings,"" *Your commands were ignored again.*  

*Is it still not functioning?*   *Yes. Its function has been lost*

""Oh...""  I said slowly, hoping they were kidding ""*But why did you want to talk to me about this now?!*""  

""I need someone to take over from you.""* The reply came all cold and clinical. A bit condescending even.* Don't let us down, Commander. You won't die if we don't recover your body.*

""There's no way!"" I shouted at them,* What? Are you saying that after everything that's happened I have to survive alone? Please...please tell me that isn't true!*  

""No."" They said calmly. ""My apologies.""

They waited for me to respond but instead I had nothing left to say. How could they! After what we went through! We had saved their entire planet from death only to be betrayed like this. It was hard to swallow words when choking back my own tears. ""How..."" I started coughing up bile before ending with a loud cough and sob. 

""Please sit down"", My partner suggested gently.   

With the chair I pulled myself upright. My heart was breaking too hard to see my hand tremoring yet somehow I reached the switch that kept the console powered and ready to use. It suddenly came alive displaying multiple commands waiting to be entered. 

""...Okay."", I breathed out as the cursor blinked at me. 

And all I wanted then was nothing more than to run away. To never come back and join my crew mates, if only they'd given us one more chance. I could hear the voices echoing around me as they talked about how excited they would all be once I returned. 

As I stepped foot down on the hatchway I could smell something foul. But I knew better than to think too long - they needed me. In the time I spent running past two of the six stations I heard hundreds or thousands (or maybe millions) of the same voice calling for me, pleading for my return. And none of them even cared whether I died.

","My radio buzzes to life again. The disembodied voice starts talking at me. It wasn’t as if it was speaking on my radio. I could hear a voice now that I think of it.

I check my communications panel and make sure nothing is coming through. All good there. Maybe it’s just a static interference. “Did you have someone else talk to you?” 

“No.” A man states back. He sounds old, but not by too much. I look around for his name tag.  There isn’t one. This time though, it’s even worse than last time. His body moves about like he is swimming. He gets all wobbly, spins, and goes completely black once. 

“Hey! Hey you there?!” “Hello?” He mumbles under his breath. “What’s your status?” He says right after. “Is this working or not?” One must be very careful if they want to keep up with him when he talks so fast. After a while he calms down slightly and lets out a sigh. “Ugh, this has been happening since before sunrise today...” 

We both have heard the distress signal since we entered orbit. We haven’t come across any survivors, which makes sense given how far away Earth is. Our main job is to fix things and continue living.

“How bad? How bad is the damage?”  He scoffs once more and gestures up towards my window where some rocks break against us.  Not a new sight. They are always trying to tear a hole through us.

A few minutes later our communication ends off without warning. Once again we see something hit us from above - an unknown object burning through our atmosphere.

We had been working for two weeks straight to find a new mission after our last ship went down during launch. This was the only one left that hadn't even begun it's journey yet and now here we were about a month after we'd supposed to have started it. 

The day had started normally enough. We were all assigned our usual tasks; I was stationed outside my station monitoring for debris and checking to see how far away each station was from us; Dr Smith got to take the break he always took and eat what little food he could grab from the main kitchen until we had time to leave; and Jones just waited around watching TV shows on his pad as the others worked. It was nice to know someone else on this station didn't know so much about engineering than you do sometimes.

","It's always good to have a backup plan, which is why the two were having their lunch on Tuesday in case of an emergency. The thing that came through first was not an immediate threat; a stray dog or something, so nobody paid much mind and sat in silence for the next hour or two, drinking in solitude. That time was when things became slightly more interesting. It was almost 3-AM so I guess it didn't hurt, but as expected from Monday Night Football fans everywhere, they all decided to start making food, thus drowning out my peace. This made me consider my actions, since I usually enjoy hearing people outside my window during this time due to them wanting their meatloaf fix after work. To be honest, if anyone did try to bother me, I would most definitely kill them unless you want your blood dripping down my weapon, so don't even try coming near here.

""Alright everyone quiet down,"" I said out loud to the mess of a group gathered outside my bedroom window. I knew they wouldn't hear me, I just wanted to make sure the last few of them realized where I was before I killed them dead. Of course the whole group heard my words thanks to the soundproofing provided by all the speakers in the room, then started yelling at each other over top of the music, probably wondering how I could hear them while surrounded by loud music but also oblivious to what happened right outside my window. Whatever, whatever you do to get your meatloaf fix on Monday night football weekend is fine by me. Just don't come buggin' me.

","My hands shook as I gripped my weapon. The tension was palpable and every inch of the blade felt heavy. I had heard the stories, some exaggerated; others too real to believe. People who carried these blades had survived near enough every war... They lived alone. Not even in the shadows where one could hide from a trained eye or ears.. My mind raced as I prepared myself for what lay ahead of me: an opponent that would test if this tool was able to do what it needed; cut through flesh like butter or fall flat on its face.

I was facing the greatest swordswoman alive. She moved so fast, she appeared and disappeared almost instantaneously. There were rumors in the city of the ""Frowning Sword"". A woman who wore a mask that gave her expressionless face. With barely any blood drawn she took out entire armies, her moves were precise, clean, and quick. So far no man had been able to win against her. At least not until now. 

She raised her arm as my opponent and pointed at me. Her hand moved so fast that none of us noticed; everyone saw her point and then the clash... The strike missed by mere inches but I knew for certain I had done the rest. It was over instantly, all was quiet save the sound of our breathing coming into full attention. As my rival turned to look at her foe, I dropped my shovel into the sand. What was left of the soldier that fell against his own chest stood up slowly; eyes downcast and trembling breath running heavy on his lips... It was finally his turn.

""Why?"" Said the swordswoman coldly while looking forward.  Her mask remained blank yet there was anger burning under it. ""I don't need such a cheap way to kill"", said the wounded man while he pulled off the bloody mask. His face was pale but still determined and ready for any fight.  The Frowning Woman was surprised. Even though the masked man had clearly fought longer than himself she did see tears fill his eyes. Tears were not meant to be shed when fighting another man nor even more tears to be shed as you lose your life to one of them. She lowered her hands in respect for the fallen man.

When they spoke after he stopped weeping the two of them stood awkwardly staring at each other. They never spoke again except for one brief conversation when both decided to end their feud forever. For the first time since they were kids, they looked beyond the masks that hid their true selves and met each other on equal ground: without judgement and hate. They learned respect and understood a simple lesson: the deathmatch ended here today because neither wanted to carry the weight of winning a meaningless battle anymore. Both parties walked away without bloodshed.

","It's really annoying when your nemesis turns up unarmed to a duel, just because he wants to keep things civilized for his opponent in advance of the fight. I don't know why I put so much weight on these sort of matters. It takes away from getting some real blood spilled and more fighting for him, you know what I mean? When is that going to end? 

This was supposed to be fun, or something like that. Now it's all stress over me. If I die here, then I want nothing but anger, not the quiet kind. He just wanted this stupid shovel. Probably made sure someone would have the right tools in place before the fighting began as well, even gave me time to get changed in case my clothes got ruined. 

He probably picked me out by name. Maybe he thought I did something stupid while swordfighting in public recently - maybe hit a guy where I couldn't swing at him correctly. Whatever the reason, I can see why we never actually had a battle last, though there have been attempts over and over again. It wouldn't be right to take anyone else's life without their consent - even if they were better than me or whatever. 

What should be done instead... Well, now isn't really the time for that. Besides, I wasn't ready anyway - too slow today, even with training. I felt every one of them hurt. A big mistake. They said I could do anything with steel and blood but I haven't used it properly yet. Or possibly ever. Should have gotten a knife first - I needed speed. My legs are okay though.

The crowd seemed interested as he explained his reasoning. He stated that his wife wished for her death more than anything else; she hated all the attention he got because he was a famous swordfighter who challenged duels for fun. She was sick when they got married so he spent their wedding night at her bedside while she was fading away like a dying ember. At first he was happy because he didn't want to go into prison and wanted more time to spend with her. Later on he started feeling guilty and wondered if he was selfish to be upset with himself when he was already a celebrity; wasn't he supposed to cherish the opportunity? No he should instead be thankful she was gone now and that nobody would ever bother him or his family again. His own father told him that being selfish was bad. He still didn't understand why his dad was always giving him so much unsolicited advice until he remembered the reason for both of them coming here today: there were other families that missed loved ones more than they did and this man came bearing the body of the woman they wanted dead. Of course their bodies wouldn't exactly look human once the last wish was granted; a couple weeks before their deaths she decided to join him after talking to someone at his work and asked that it become public knowledge that their lives were cut short by one lone individual who killed another in a foolish battle amongst peers. Not even friends.

There's only two ways to kill someone with an enchanted weapon. You either use the magic to enhance your blade or you use it to destroy it and then kill someone with a blunt object using whatever remains. In our case, we are able to break through magical barriers with metal objects. That is how he survived all this time so no wonder he was such a great fighter, maybe he actually had the guts to do it too! We weren't sure; he never volunteered for extra missions though so that meant his ability might have been fake. But how had he gotten past so many of the knights without being noticed, especially since this area was overrun with mages ready to take down anyone who would hurt their employers! They must have gotten a tip off from someone telling them the fight lasted far longer than expected and the thief must have waited behind the crowd, probably getting paid to wait. Either way, he escaped to warn us before getting captured. Good thing our leader was brave, apparently some people can't handle the pain. So we gathered weapons and went in to get him. Our spells worked perfectly. When he realized that he couldn't escape anymore, he used a dark pact to call back upon whoever gifted him his powers in the first place, making sure to tell them that he deserved to be tortured and burned alive. The mages summoned a small demon to burn him for eternity; I guess that's a good deal to make in exchange for helping you kill a guy years later. As it turned out, they managed to get his soul and gave him up so he doesn't have to see it done to him, but he still has to watch every single person close to us face the same fate.

Three months ago this man who looked just like someone else had walked into my life and told me his name was Richard - the only problem was, there wasn't an easy way for me to say 'I'm really glad we met'. Not at least as long as his story goes that he is indeed real.

The last time I checked, my girlfriend Emily was standing somewhere across town waiting for me because of a work trip she went on. She promised she would call when she got settled. That happened two days after she left, and nothing since - I still can't get over the shock even now. Now suddenly I am being called out by a Richard looking exactly like my girlfriend right here beside me? It was too much; it was unbelievable. I didn't know what to do. My brain screamed at me, wanting answers while simultaneously wanting to make him go. The thing about mental illness is - sometimes people don't understand their own struggles enough. But neither does yours truly...

And then all of a sudden he took my hand. ""It's okay, I promise I won't leave you again,"" he said. His eyes were so full of despair they made me feel bad. When I tried explaining everything - all the tears, the phone calls, the missed calls, all the empty promises - that is when he understood where the mistake was - that he shouldn't have stayed away. That he could be part of the solution. After three months apart, we finally had the answer to our questions. We can never see each other face to face due to some serious medical condition he carries, but at least we found ways to talk to each other every day. The rest fell into place from then onwards. He learned to stay around me and let me explain why I did things a certain way - maybe if he had known better he wouldn't have gotten so hurt in the first place...

","I watched as I had fallen asleep that night, in my youth bed, curled in my sheet. Today was the last day I got to do this without falling a sleep; but tomorrow I would not want to live any more.

""Another year passed and everything I feared of was brought into being,"" I thought. The words I hated to hear every morning rolled from my mouth once again, ""It has been a year since you were diagnosed with the deadly disease, John"". All three words: It has. Been. A year. In the past. But at least now, I don't have to think about what lies on the other side when I die. Because there isn't any one else who feels like me. At least anyone who does should be dead long ago by this point. Which only means my feelings get stronger each new passing day, before another 50 years pass away on earth. Then after yet another half century passes, and all those feeling turn true, because someone comes along, makes time stop completely and I can start seeing things from their perspective for the first time ever. And again just like before, I get to relive it all over again.

Today I went back through some of my most cherished memories, to spend time with people whom I haven't seen in years. They still look great now and it warms my heart knowing they will continue to do so for another few decades. Every generation continues on through its lifespan as it does for mine, however they tend to go out quickly compared to how long I have left. So even though the amount of time spent together is short, it's precious, because when it comes to time alone, we never really know how much more time we'll actually have.


Then came along a different type of happy moment where I wished I could go back ten, no twenty or even thirty years. Maybe I could see if there are people who fit the age that matches my current self, and try and talk to them. Or maybe even be able to spend some time with somebody before the end came calling, only for them to leave my world for good before I could say goodbye properly...

But I did something different. Instead of playing games I spoke to her on the phone for almost 2 hours while making fun of her family, and friends, teasing both parents about our own children.. By the next day I received notification that she died shortly after I did. 18 years later I met a lovely woman named Veronica. Even though we didn't have kids together we lived a very similar life to how mine has, only we enjoyed many hobbies together which strengthened our bond that helped me enjoy my time before my mortality ended. We didn't speak for 4 months, but whenever I stopped thinking about whether or not the others would return I managed to find the same joy in talking with Veronica again just the way I felt when I could hear voices with loved ones. There wasn't so much dread around death anymore because now the void that was my existence without speaking to loved ones meant nothing now because that space has filled again now with two seperate humans who remind me why I chose to stay alive for so many more years than average. That's always been the greatest thing about being trapped here, that I have the possibility to connect with those I love one day, rather than going it alone, even if for the rest of eternity. As long as it happens sooner then I expected, I'm glad to have waited longer because otherwise it wouldn't have happened yet anyway. And for that I am thankful.

","""Hey, you okay?""

Yes, yes I am fine. I have no reason to ask him that question because his words weren't directed at me. He was speaking directly to the woman with brown hair next to him...the same woman who just sat down on my lap minutes ago as if she knew where I had been all this time.

Well, he did ask me that. Maybe in some other timeline, but in my own, he didn't say anything, let alone ask me something in front of her.

Then again, maybe only people from my past were allowed inside Heaven? Or at least those from before now existed. If I went back and killed the girl she wasn't mine, there wouldn't even be a 'me'. She died while waiting for me after school last week. That damn car hit her running across the street when it ran over my friend Jason. Oh, right, the one she was dating too. Damn, sorry...I mean I loved him too....and her brother...I guess that makes me part of Jason's Family.

He asked why I was so distracted and how I could think about things like that after coming out to everyone. There were definitely more girls here. Not saying any names though. Just because we made it into heaven doesn't mean their family isn't still alive or whatever. And well, seeing another version of them around is sure tough to take sometimes....and besides what will they think if i act weird towards them? Plus they might judge my personality. Some can tell by the way I carry myself that it has become difficult to enjoy company. It's hard not to always notice someones eyes staring at you every time you move, especially since I don't know how long these souls will live out their lives here. Most probably years...if they get to see anyone at all. Mine is limited by memory; an endless loop through each passing day. Every few weeks though I can change something-a letter sent off, a decision to make, etc, although I can't do much of anything without someone knowing anyway. No matter who it is I try to bring them around, its just hard not wanting others to see me smile in return. Sometimes I even end up crying alone, wondering ""Do you miss me?"", ""Can we talk?"", ""Wanna come to lunch together?"". Then when everything starts to look okay and they laugh along just the thought breaks it and I feel embarrassed and sad. What happened to being alone? When everything is easy and I can't see any soul watching but us four in the library. Maybe one day they'll understand and accept me, maybe today wasn't the day.

""Is she alright?"" he asks, raising both eyebrows toward the blonde haired female.

I quickly nod to her and keep walking. My feet begin to ache since walking is all there is left of ""normal"" anymore. One does lose balance on one leg sometime when going upstairs all that time either sideways or upside down.....maybe that's what happens to folks here when memories die? Anyhow, enough babbling from me.

The rest of my sentence fades away until finally I reach the office where Ms. Brown meets me every morning. She always tries to greet me properly and asks me how I'm doing, even tho I always leave feeling empty and confused. Today is no different; the girl smiles sadly and I give a halfhearted hug. The first day after having gone crazy I thought ""I wish she was my daughter"", now that's a reality for me.

It's a real shame too since I have another name now. The last two souls I saw yesterday disappeared pretty quick after all. They must not have liked talking about themselves or not remembering. This is kinda scary actually. Not that scary, I never felt scared ever actually but kind of. Like I shouldn't have gotten emotional but I really did. Those things happen sometimes and aren't supposed to but I need time. Time to find her again, or something else. At the moment, I should be looking forward to my meeting with him, unless it's not actually him. Now I can't remember any of my friends names except for hers, which sucks bigtime since we spend most of our days here laughing at dumb jokes.

Except, when you got mad or frustrated you called 'em morons and made fun of them constantly. I swear to god that dude would write notes and comments under your papers and then yell at you personally when you told him otherwise. A bunch of douches. Same goes for the fat bastard across the table in English whose biggest contribution to English Class was making stupid jokes about girls and shit like that. Those bastards sucked but nobody's gonna care. God, I'd rather go back to hanging out there instead of working with these losers.

There were others but I stopped counting after twenty or so. Honestly, hell be damned if I don't start counting again tonight. Gotta meet up with one of my pals tomorrow, and I got plenty of opportunities to mess with those kids later in the week/month/year, depending on the specific game in mind. Well, gotta figure out what game I want to play tonight though. Might cheat myself sick and use the timer, fuck the rules. Who cares if I break character. Everyone knows I have bad luck anyways.

","I don't remember the exact moment my life ended. I only remember looking into heaven, hoping for a way back after finally being put in peace with my wife and kids when I thought of how hard this was going to be for them. It was peaceful there but also had an emptiness inside me that I couldn't place.

Now I can see why as everything came out to me at once: All the things I took for granted all those years ago now were meaningless. Every fight I lost I could replay in a blink of an eye; every good deed done didn't make a difference in my life anymore but every terrible thing that happened did impact the lives of others. In truth nothing about life matters, everyone dies with the same ending except people who really made a life count by doing something great or even helping someone get past their own struggles will live forever.

As days turn into years we never get better off. Everything keeps getting worse because now everybody knows what to do if they are angry, frustrated, sad etc so they stop living because nothing matters anyway. Instead you have these stupid petty little fights over trivial issues all around us making each other more lonely. I hate it but no one helps and no one wants to change anything either. Everyone else remembers me as a selfish bastard after they went through some hardship and died with only moments left in their mortal coil but they just ignored me then but hey who cares? If i wasn't trying to find a way back in they wouldn't even know who I am but now im stuck with nothing and nobody so they want me dead too. I guess thats fine though; at least its not another fucking worthless soul.

","I sat down next to a woman who appeared in front of me, her face white with fear as tears streamed down her cheeks. I was there for the second time as a witness; she knew what was happening, however I had not realized what was happening when I first came here; the faces that passed me by were all ones I already knew... or rather someone similar seemed to pass in my current reality.

""Come on man! It took them 4 weeks just get out!"" She said, wiping her tears as she ran towards where he had walked. ""It was supposed to only take an hour?"" He looked back at me as though surprised, and before he could answer, she grabbed his arm and held tight, and screamed even louder ""How the hell did I miss that?""

A little chuckle came from beside me. The guy from behind me nodded as he reached around and tapped the air above him twice in a quick succession as if this entire event has happened many times in the past. ""You have a right to go home, yes but you have no right to run."" He gestured with his hands and suddenly we both saw her sitting down on the edge of the grassy hill looking up at the sky watching us watch over the girl in distress.

Her body began to glow faintly as I heard someone call her name again and again, until finally it started to become so bright that a pair of blue eyes opened as bright and wide as any normal pair could. One of those beautiful brown eyes gazed upon me, the other gazing at the ground as it faded from view, into the endless blue darkness. I blinked my eyes open, my mouth watering with hunger as another large amount of darkness surrounded me again.

""It seems like something out of a sci-fi book or movie.""
model
A low hum resonated throughout the entire ship when you came around the corner to confront them, which made you stop and stare. You were not alone, a tall woman stood right beside them. Both had short black hair pulled back tight with elastics and were wearing uniforms. She held her hand out slightly so that she was standing facing away from you and she held her hand out toward you as if it was some sort of invitation for conversation or perhaps even greeting.  

You looked again at your colleagues: each one staring straight ahead in shock and awe before turning to face forward once more. As you stared down at her outstretched hand you couldn't help but wonder what exactly she wanted because they seemed very nervous about whatever they were going to tell you. They were dressed completely differently from us - none of them even wore white lab coats as usual. 

As you moved in a polite nod, you approached her as best as you could. With both of her hands on the side bars now you slowly reached out and closed in, finally getting a good look at them. Their hair didn't quite reach the middle of their neck and although they had several small earrings dangling from either earlobe their clothes appeared as though they would have been perfectly clean if there hadn't been sweat dripping down their cheeks. Her face appeared very different from yours: not only because of her wide open eyes, but most notably was the way she opened her mouth as if ready to talk. 

She smiled broadly as soon as you stepped into full view.

""Greetings fellow traveler! We will be taking you somewhere soon!"" she shouted over to her companion who was still fiddling with a large box that sat above his head. She gave a slight tug which made the box fall, creating a small bang that sent little red sparks up a tiny hole in the corner of the top. For a moment the room went silent as everyone turned to see the sparks rise into thin columns before dying down almost as fast. It did seem like she knew that they were scared, so she tried to calm them down by speaking soothingly, but when two of the soldiers started jumping forward to get closer to grab this box the crowd quickly became agitated. 

With one hand pointed upward you gestured the rest of them towards the seats. There weren't many, probably just big enough for the five of you and you hoped they wouldn't argue. 

The woman seemed to understand and moved her other half, causing another spark to explode. She waved the pair of lightsabers that hung from her belt casually and then put the first in front of someone in charge of carrying passengers (the captain). Each of you followed suit and placed your own weapon behind your chair.

The women gave one last smile to you and then took control as everyone settled into their respective seats, holding a finger aloft before motioning for a dark cloud of fireballs shot across the room. With the darkness being instantly extinguished you took a second to look up in the direction of the fireball...and let out a high pitched scream. Behind you, several figures materialized, aiming small weapons of sorts and firing towards the smoke.

(FTL meaning faster than light)","""It's not possible.""

All eyes turned to look at me. I looked back into everyones surprised face. There was fear in there. My race had just been invaded and we now know why we are on their war list. Our technology had gotten too far beyond our reach, leaving us without even basic knowledge about its origins.

""They are probably aware of it already, so let's hope this new weapon doesn't work. Either way, I think we should try it first. We have plenty of spare materials for weapons, if you get what I mean..."" I said as I continued to make my presentation to Congress about the dangers of FTL travel and the implications of our sudden discovery of faster-than-light ships coming from elsewhere. The people of Earth were already paranoid, fearful of all things beyond their own planet. They hadn't known since the beginning of time they could travel faster than light, but now all these strange figures were starting to take advantage of it and suddenly Earth wasn't afraid of them anymore.

My speech went on as usual, but soon some more people joined in, speaking from different planets and universes. While they weren't much of a talkative society, they had discovered how to communicate across vast distances in a flash thanks to our new discovery of FTL. After spending decades trying everything to understand this ""science"", they finally figured out a way. Now we saw dozens of these alien species sharing stories of themselves while some tried to contact other races from their universe.

I stopped speaking for a bit. This was happening right now, they were all looking at me as if I was telling another lie. But I actually meant what I was saying. ""Is everyone here?"" I asked again, though no one answered.

Now all of my colleagues stood up and started to speak simultaneously. Some spoke first about the existence of life in the galaxy, others began telling tales of various cultures that lived amongst different planets. It felt like it might never end, and yet somehow I knew that it would. 
But what did I know? When you're used to hearing voices across entire continents, listening to music composed by other cultures and reading stories told countless times over, you learn how to ignore whatever nobody wants to acknowledge. All of us knew exactly what those alien species wanted to tell us: We're gonna invade.


That night came very soon after my final words. They arrived quietly and silently as any normal visitors would do, although they still didn't need rockets or fighter aircrafts for that. They appeared out of thin air, slowly growing larger and larger until they occupied most of the sky and left behind huge craters and smoke plumes wherever they touched down. Within minutes humans started running away, seeking shelter under concrete slabs and underneath piles of boulders.

Then we heard screams. One sound became many, each man hiding himself next to whoever he considered closest. Many years later in history books those who hid found it impossible to be saved. By the time anyone reached our current cities only scattered bodies, broken bones and empty helmets remained - nothing else survived the invasion of aliens using unknown science far beyond ours. Yet despite the devastation I guess humanity managed to grow out of this terror. Still, for centuries after this day, whenever somebody says ""faster than light"", people recall those who couldn't handle it.

(FTL meaning faster than light)","""We have achieved the greatest feat in human history,"" Dr. Albert Smith shouted across the room as his fellow humans applauded behind him on stage at the annual Human Spacefarer's convention. ""We have done what seemed impossible only moments ago: we have crossed into hyperspace.""

The crowd erupted in applause. The previous year had been filled with rumors of this invention, but no one believed it was possible. All this hype had gotten to be too much. They'd spent hours preparing speeches for any possible outcome- and now after 3 months of waiting, their worst fears were realized by these new aliens. 

A delegation consisting of two dozen individuals had travelled from another planet within our galaxy three years prior. Since that meeting, the human governments world wide had worked tirelessly upon replicating their technology so that it could be used here on Earth instead.

""My name is Albert Michael Smith, I am chief scientist here at the Institute for Theoretical Physics and Research, where I am also chief scientist for all human ventures out of this solar system"". He pauses to pause some audience member who was yelling something about time dilation and relativistic contractions

""And my colleagues would want me to state-"" he interrupts himself and smiles again. It seems like his whole presentation is really going well, despite them not knowing what they're talking about. After he states that he doesn't know what relativistic contractions are either, he says ""Oh yeaaah! Time dilation is real!"" and proceeds to explain the concept while holding a toy rubber duck in his hand (his personal favorite). ""But since neither of those terms actually make sense, I will just say that we know what hyper speed is! It appears our guests don't speak english...""


This is how the world learned about FTL. In less than ten minutes, humans had made the most ridiculous statement imaginable yet the first interstellar traveler had landed somewhere on our doorstep. It did not take very long before other worlds began sending envoys over to see if they were able to replicate what Albert Smith claimed to be true. Not many people wanted the earthlings to remain ignorant of FTL because they never really paid attention to physics back home anyway. So when they discovered they didn't believe anything, not even Relativity, they became angry at us, assuming that everything we knew wasn't true, and immediately launched missions to find a way to break through the barrier and meet up with us. Many times these failed attempts resulted in catastrophic explosions. Only a handful had managed to land safely however, and none of these crews spoke English or had seen the Earth before landing. None of them had arrived with any equipment other than weapons... 

The end result? The aliens quickly developed hostile feelings towards the humanity and started fighting for resources, wanting more food, air, etc., to keep their own civilization alive. In fact many of them took offense at humanity thinking that such a phenomenon could exist due to their advanced tech. How dare they think that our world wouldn't develop FTL! 

At that point everyone thought that we had fucked things up badly. There were few options left: either surrender/capitulate, form a super militaristic coalition to defend ourselves against this new alien invasion, or start our own interdimensional portal experiment which would destroy entire dimensions beyond anything we ever could have imagined...

(FTL meaning faster than light)","""This is no longer a reality, this is a fairy tale,"" said one Captain at a United Earth Council meeting. He tapped lightly his fingers on the table in front of him, his eyes wide with disbelief. ""How could anyone so far behind us have developed something like that?""

The other Captains had similar expressions on their faces. A couple even whispered to each other. It took more than 50 years to develop Space Drive and most of its components were very hard and expensive. They all wanted to see how it looked like but only a few had received permission for the expedition. Most were sent instead on normal missions.

When the first Captain returned, he explained everything about the ship: its construction method, its workings, what kind of power source was used... But the real shock came later. After examining the crew log, reading every single entry and watching videos taken during their mission, the captains realized they had found themselves in a new quadrant. Some humans from a small world called 'Planet Z' had discovered their own solution to reach speeds beyond lightspeed and even created a whole colony within a Dyson Sphere near their star while living through interdimensional portals. No wonder nobody ever knew of them before since they could just jump into any universe they wished to visit.

To make things worse, human ingenuity proved itself once again by creating new technology and techniques which allowed them to use their warp drives further than they expected, resulting in the discovery of yet another unknown galaxy filled with intelligent species who already learned how to harness their warp drive for military purposes. Now, even humanity became a potential threat.

All of the captains stood speechless as the Prime Minister rose and announced: *""Humans! You know that this war has been going on much longer than you realise, right? Your race doesn't stand a chance against our superior scientific methods.""*

And then he smiled sinisterly. *""We were aware of your arrival long ago. We decided not to interfere until now because we were waiting for you to grow stronger and more powerful. However, enough is enough!""*

He paused briefly for dramatic effect. ""*I suggest all of you pack up and leave, immediately. This planet belongs to both ourselves and you!*""

Some started arguing among themselves but eventually everybody realised what happened. Their planet was not empty as they thought. The aliens were not there because of a lack of funds or manpower, but rather a strategic miscalculation and lack of foresight. The fact that one group of people, despite being far weaker in terms of population or resources, managed to build such advanced weaponry only meant they had been working harder than others. In truth, many of their species didn't even have a concept of basic physics, never mind developing such technologies - they simply thought that using their knowledge and ability to predict events would be sufficient.

He smiled wider than before, a wicked grin that had me sweating slightly for the second time. ""Oh that was only the beginning!"" He stood up, grabbed some papers, slid one across my desk and flipped them open on top of another table.

""This is the contract."" He read off the words, laughing when the words were met by silence from me; *What can you expect?* ""So much more than that little contract of yours was meant to make!""

He moved to close his books, but I gently caught the pages and sat down beside him once more, waiting patiently as he came to sit in front of me again, ready to continue explaining the events leading up to this moment and how we ended up here. His eyes were glinting brighter than ever now as if there wasn't an ounce of guilt or shame within his soul anymore. Only amusement was visible in the dark abyss of his pupils now, and he began reading aloud the name of this document signed by both parties on the last night of December - The Pact of Redemption.

""I am the devil,"" said the voice that emerged from the void, ""and I'm here because you have been an extremely terrible person. You are on the verge of being dragged to Hell."" The voice spoke with such power that even people standing far away could hear it. 

You were not a believer but the man who delivered you this horrible news was so powerful you could tell he was serious. He had brought him back up from a very long sleep. For years humans believed demons would eat their souls and deliver them to hell until finally they learned enough about what demons do to make them realize no one is going to hell as long as they pray every day. These demons can't get any closer then the edge of death or you would be burned right down like paper, and if they couldn't burn you without leaving any trace they wouldn't bother.

And though they may think themselves victorious, they are mistaken. While their efforts may have cost me everything, all this pain will only add fuel to my fire. All these people who watched this unfold thought of me as nothing more than some crazy man screaming in the street. How wrong are they!"" With each passing second, my anger grows until I see everyone's heads snap up. My smile has never widened so wide.

It was only moments ago when we fought. We fought against our allies. But now I am alone standing atop a smoldering building at the center of New York City while a thousand people stand around, weapons trained on both of us. I look toward the city's skyline once again, its destruction an abomination beyond any language. In fact, all humanity itself might be. A few hours ago our entire base held 30 billion beings in existence. 4 hours later, none were left. Their screams still haunt me even today. 

My hatred burns but what comes after rage? What will remain after my revenge? There is no one here who believes I understand this or any meaning in life other than what I take from others. Yet as this battle ends, another begins. The most important thing I ever learned during this week-long ordeal was that every person who believed in me, who supported me, those who loved me are now the ones whose demise defines me. That leaves only one other thing: hate. I must avenge all the innocents I lost, but more importantly the ones I couldn't save. I close my eyes shut tight for just a moment and allow myself to feel the warmth of the air above me and below me. It isn't the same cold wind I used to know in my youth, nor is it the warm sun rays that bathe me on good days. Both of which are a luxury I no longer possess since I can no longer distinguish between day and night, because darkness covers everything in equal measure. No matter how much damage is done to me, how weak I become, my body remembers the warmth...the sensation of the Sun.

But that feeling would not last forever. Another wave of explosions shakes the ground underneath the remaining soldiers. More of their bodies start to melt into pools of molten rock, but I don't care. Today, their souls go to eternal hell, but tomorrow I will ascend to heaven. Once again I look down at them; I cannot tell which army I was part of anymore. One hundred and eighty six million bullets, missiles, lasers, knives, guns, and swords. Nothing could defeat the strength of mind that resided inside me. They were able to tear apart my heart and my soul from within however, it took something stronger to break me. Now, if anyone saw me as anything I'd like them to remember me as: Unbreakable. When finally their attacks dwindled I grabbed onto one soldier and dragged him along until he fell unconscious beside his comrades. His flesh pulsed as it healed despite the injuries that I inflicted. He could stand upright and walk. I could walk and speak freely, yet his legs couldn't keep him moving. I looked over his neck. Blood seeped out, but I didn't worry too much over the issue. This wasn't unlike what had happened many times before, so I walked away leaving him behind. 

""You are weak,"" whispered the fallen soldier. Though, I understood that he said it as a statement rather than as advice I accepted the truth. When his chest began to rise back into normal rhythm he spoke again, ""Do whatever you want to do."" I turned my head slowly to meet his gaze. An empty stare greeted me, or at least I did for five seconds before the rest of his head exploded and blew off where his skull should be. So far I hadn't broken a single bone among the hundreds of thousands that had laid waste to me, and only after the two deaths in front of me did I begin to realize how strong humans are. They were able to move under such brutal torture, and then destroy it completely in response.

The battle came to an end not through combat as there seemed to be several ways of achieving victory. The best way probably is to simply surrender. Some fools decide they are worthy for a reason, and some fools choose suicide as a last resort. Most common of these fools die immediately but only one of the three of them lived long enough to kill the final enemy. To them I would offer thanks, they chose honorably. As a parting gift he gave me his rifle and sword, which I returned respectfully to him.

","You know what happened before I became the Evil Overlord?

The worst of humanity was always so goddamn arrogant and complacent. But they were still human at that point. What they did to their country is something that's been done repeatedly throughout history: conquer the Earth only after claiming that mankind wouldn't be able to save itself or the next guy would come along to stop them. 

""No other nations will be able to stop me."" One person said when the time came for him to take over. He died not from the hand of anyone who fought against his will, but because he didn't notice when nobody in the world gave up on keeping themselves alive just because of one man. Humans are a strange species though, especially considering how long we have been trying to destroy each other. After he was declared Emperor/King/Supreme Dictator (it changed every ten minutes due to some idiotic military council) and started ruling the entirety of Europe, there was no chance of escaping. The people didn't bother protesting. In fact, many thought it might even get better if all the wars stopped at once - this warlord claimed the most significant source of our pain. So the humans gave up everything and submitted to the rule of an autocrat from a place where nobody lived anyway. All those nukes weren't worth a damn! Had this emperor actually gone off planet or destroyed earth as planned, we could have made sure he died first with enough radiation. Instead, we turned the lights back on and continued living under dictatorship. Only recently, another autocrat appeared. Another fool like the one before decided that humanity wasn't truly deserving of life anymore, and had set the stage again for nuclear annihilation. His end was quite a bit more honorable than the last one though; he was shot by someone whose face never appeared onscreen. Not sure what that says about our progress.

And as I look out across the crowd of humanity, all the same as it was at least the last time I saw it centuries ago, I can't help but wonder whether we really are capable of saving ourselves. Especially when we haven't managed to escape my own bullshit after all these years.

Just so they can start anew while we're in our golden age once more.

Oh right. The reason I wanted this whole destruction thing in place was actually that I knew what would happen when I die and needed a little something to spice up my world. As for how it will come down to you probably won't live past this but that isn't a question for me. As I've died at least a dozen times, I have no concern as to whether or not there will be anything left of me after I make all of you realize just how awesome I truly am and why, through some twisted fate, none of you will ever appreciate my genius. I know my sacrifice will go unmissed, ignored perhaps even ridiculed by those pathetic humans, yet...it'll serve as a lesson for next time. 

Humans are always screwing things up for themselves unless I'm watching over them or else they become too busy blaming someone else instead of taking responsibility.

Yeah that's it I know you idiots aren't going to like this so please take it like I mean it because it sounds nice coming from me. Good luck fixing whatever fucked up mess you've made!

182,"You head into Applebee's to meet your blind date. After verifying the reservation the host takes you to a table at the back of the restaurant....where a humanoid, clearly female Cthulhu is sitting. Looking around no one else is freaking out, and you'e still sane despite the circumstances.
","“Welcome.”  The waitress said with a smile. 

I had waited for my appointment since I booked it almost a month ago; even though we have never met before in person. The first time meeting online always leaves a little anxiety. She called me on the phone to double-check that we would be okay being seen together at this small applebees in downtown town where everything was quiet enough except for some loud screaming children yelling over a tv about pokemon. 

The woman at the counter held up her hand as she looked confused. “Well now we’ve got somebody to show him. Let’s take him to his table!”

And like the calm mother she was, she led me towards a large empty booth in the corner. We sat down there after she opened the door wide open so I could see if anyone from work came through for lunch. There were a few people in here waiting, but I quickly saw them all leave. I don’t know why, but once our eyes locked and they left their seats and walked toward us I didn’t feel nervous anymore. A couple couples went through before either of us spoke. And soon another two groups decided on other tables. And then finally when three more sat down across from both of us we started talking.

She told me she used the name Clara; most women like that just wouldn’t use anything as long as it wasn’t Clara. Apparently, I shouldn’t say that in any way that sounds bad. But who cares! If something’s going well with my girlfriend or date, there’s only ever one winner and it’s her. When everyone arrived the last table, I couldn’t see Clara very well, and honestly, her face had been looking a little paler than normal so I was glad there was nothing I didn’t immediately recognize.  After staring blankly at each others faces I let out an awkward laugh. We could tell it wasn’t the right thing to do at the moment, but in truth we probably never will have the chance again. I don’t want it to end here because it is a beautiful Saturday afternoon and I really wanted this date to go on forever. Maybe Clara noticed my discomfort, because while still smiling, she leaned slightly in to give me my drink and made sure that my water glass didn’t fall when the waiter passed by to clear a plate or refill drinks. It was too bad that it didn’t turn out to be someone new when he cleared away another one of our plates to take our orders and brought us menus. Instead, he gave me a look that reminded me of the girl behind the counter. Her expression seemed concerned yet resigned. Well he must have felt he knew what to say though. He gave me a friendly nod and continued on to check the next couple near the front of the restaurant. My date watched him walk past, not saying anything, until I handed her a napkin to wipe her mouth off after she took a sip of her soda. Her lips began forming words, and I encouraged her, trying not to let slip the concern creeping into my mind.

""Whos that?""

""Oh? Who are you talking to honey?""

She pointed. I smiled. Of course, it was stupid to freak out like this. This isn’t weird at all. It has happened to so many couples in the history of this town. Nothing should shock her more than the fact that she’s dating a handsome man like me. Not to mention that nobody is going to believe me if I try to explain about the whole alien abduction bit later when we get home to make dinner. ""What is it? Did she call you fat?"" She laughed a little and I asked how long she'd known.  A very familiar redhead came to our table with a bottle opener in her hands as she set our beverages in front of me. I thought I might lose it in the beginning, but then I remembered all those guys I had gone on dates with that refused to go out on weekdays instead wanting to spend every weekend night taking advantage of the romantic glow of a nice candlelight ambience.  Instead of drinking my coke alone in silence until it was drained, or worse, giving myself a migraine with my second glass without refills or leaving out the sodas, I realized that spending half a dollar on a soft drink could be a great start to a wonderful evening with the woman who seems like an extremely good fit for me. Plus, I need to watch out for the competition because there are more women than men who want to break through my emotional shield as easily as I did mine.  ""It’s been exactly six months.""


“Wow, six months! Oh my god! You can’t be serious. What was our sixth month anniversary?”

We looked at each other for a moment, I think it helped her to realize that everything was fine. I smiled and looked forward to answering the question she didn’t ask: ""when did you decide you wanted to keep seeing someone again?!""


She stood up and grabbed my hand. ""That's crazy! Congratulations!""


I hugged her tight. ""Thanks! So now that your glasses are safely under here, can I introduce you all?""



There was no mistaking it.  Our waitress, Susan, had also turned out to be quite a popular sight in town as well. She was probably the reason why she was the only other human in the whole damn place. ""Clara, I think its time you introduced your friends!""

","""That's why I said they were supposed to be cute,"" my sister sighed as we walked into the cafe, trying to act excited but failing miserably, ""I mean who doesn't want to eat in the most boring coffee shop in America?""

""Yeah, so how long have you two been dating?""

""Two weeks."" 

""Well I guess it's not like that guy had any competition,"" she shrugged. We both looked towards our left where a woman sat alone staring intensely at her tablet as if it were some sort of high profile game console. She was talking on the phone though, telling him the game was unfair and all sorts of other nonsense, probably because he was an absolute prick in real life since this seemed exactly like something her type would do. My brother, as far as he could tell, did nothing wrong either way and only wanted a casual relationship with her for companionship as they shared similar tastes.

My hands got clammy as I pushed forward through the door into the brightly lit café. People scattered around the area barely noticed me until after I took the booth beside a figure seemingly made of shadows that stretched up from beneath the surface of his worn leather chair as best as anyone could possibly manage. The latter quickly shuffled over to meet us when we entered before looking across the room with eyes as empty and cold as the void above his head as he slowly extended a hand toward the girl next to me, gesturing for her to rise with a flick of his fingers. The girl, surprised by the sudden commotion and slight shiver down her spine, stood up without a sound. He raised a brow to indicate he meant business then continued speaking to himself while walking away once more. This must be their date spot.

Before I began to panic too much I patted his shoulder reassuringly hoping to put his mind at ease and thanked him politely for his time. He let out a long sigh relieved that everything had gone well. As soon as I finished thanking him abruptly he turned towards me. The human form dissipated completely leaving behind just darkness, giving way to four pairs of glowing yellow, green, brown and red eye holes. They stared at me intently holding onto our last hope for sanity and happiness that perhaps this man wasn't some kind of monster. My sister grabbed his arm as he went down to speak yet stopped herself half way.

Instead he simply looked me in the eyes with a blank expression that spoke volumes about what the situation entailed. I felt myself fall into the trap all too familiar to my siblings, always being treated like they are not normal or anything special which I suppose isn't far off mark in this case but I digress...

He smiled weakly, nodding his head at first making sure nobody within earshot noticed his reaction and then shaking his head repeatedly to dispel his emotions before continuing again, trying to muster the energy to continue in the conversation. His voice sounded weak when he finally asked me if we were hungry. I nodded eagerly, wondering how many more times his tone will remain the same. ""So, uh, I'm here with a buddy of mine...we actually met in highschool."" He scratched his beard awkwardly as if unsure what to say next. I glanced down at my feet. Our friend obviously didn't seem to know how this whole thing was expected to work. ""Right. Well, we usually hang out right across the street. What kind of food do you like? Fries are fine. Oh, pizza's good too."" It started off really poorly, thank god he couldn't read my mind. ""Oh yeah, I haven't eaten here..."" A brief moment of awkward silence followed by a small chuckle escaped his lips.

""Yeah I think there used to be one nearby college grounds but they closed down."" That was a new one; was this a bad move? Could he sense something negative, but masked it well enough that his expression remained neutral even now as he spoke in his thick English accent. If the rest of the staff members knew how dangerous this place actually was then they might have alerted authorities already but I doubt that given the lack of security guards stationed outside and inside the building. ""Anyway!"" he suddenly exclaimed before I could react. ""What kind of burger are you eating?""

After recovering somewhat I thought that maybe if we keep things lighthearted he wouldn't notice any abnormalities but it was only going downhill from there! One bite...two bites...three bites...all in his name...he kept asking us questions to find out how long we were dating, did we go out before, etc. None of us really enjoyed listening but I suppose we were committed at this point. I bit down hard on the edge of a cheeseburger which came out smelling almost burnt, then swallowed and tried to swallow another large piece of meat covered chicken sausage, feeling slightly nauseous each time I consumed something due to his increasingly invasive probing. By this point I could sense he was becoming impatient, although he hid it rather well. At least he has perfect posture when he speaks and uses correct grammar. I was glad he wasn't speaking as much. He gave a final nod of approval for the amount of fries and napkins on the table. I wanted to push his plate off the counter but decided against it. He turned back to speak with his face lit with the look of someone finally starting to enjoy their meal for the first time since dinner...

","""Hi, honey, come on in! I was waiting for you.""

There she was, just like in the profile picture I had sent her yesterday, except real, alive, breathing, smelling nice and whatnot.  The woman who looked exactly like this lady from Tinder walked up with her arm outstretched for me to shake: not awkward or anything... but as if it wasn't so weird we were shaking hands in the middle of an applebees. Like when my girlfriend took my hand before our wedding. 

She put her hand behind the collar of her green shirt. 

I went to take it and squeeze her hand... and realized there weren't really any fingers to grab. They ended right before the base of them, leaving something big underneath. The only thing making noise was what sounded vaguely like a tiny motor that hummed softly, a gentle sound barely noticeable under all the other din ringing through the room. She was staring straight ahead of her while her chest shook violently, breathing heavy; her eyes never once made contact with mine. In fact, they were looking past me entirely, toward some unseen entity.

My gaze followed hers to see that someone, standing near the door with the same glowing golden aura as her, was staring *at* her. It didn't make sense; his face remained emotionless, no indication whatsoever of horror, disgust or fear - and yet the glow emanating from him must be what drew my gaze first. Something about his form gave off a primal feeling, ancient; he looked like those statues found in museums by mistake, or some kind of fossilized creature. His skin was rough and cracked like leather, covered by long dark hair that stuck awkwardly to his forehead. 

Her eyes shifted briefly towards me, and I noticed a thin layer of blood smeared over most of her lower lip, along with red gash across her eye-socket. And then, it came: That deep, booming roar echoing within us both, bouncing between walls of brick as it resonated throughout the space above and below where she stood, filling my ears with its volume. Though, surprisingly, nothing seemed to stir in her body apart from a tremor that seemed to reach down to mine heart. No sweat dripping from her brow, nor did she clutch at it; but a subtle wave of shock spread between us that left me gasping a little myself. Her jaw clenched, releasing another soft cry, and her tongue peeked out as if trying to taste the air - though she could still speak obviously enough, just now there was a tremor in her words.  

So we stood silently for almost half a minute, until finally she let go of my hand and started speaking slowly: ""How do... how have you survived?""

","My mouth formed a perfect circle where my teeth should be but I tried hard not to smile as I entered the restaurant. A soft neon glow bathed the waiting area in an unnatural orange hue and hummed faintly as its bulb burnt slowly and unevenly throughout the room. The receptionist scanned her tablet frantically but when she finished typing in information for me I was ushered through the side door with hardly a word said by anyone aside from the man who had been following me.

I had chosen Applebees because that’s how we met in real life. She thought it sounded fancy. When he said they hadn’t eaten there since he got married I figured it would be the place to get together if I didn’t have any kids and wanted someone special. 

“There you go” He indicated a table at the far end of the hall. “At least the booth is available.” 

He pointed towards another group but his eyes followed them like a stray dog and my stomach began to churn. There were two women and this weird looking girl all dressed in brown and black clothing. Maybe some kind of gang? What seemed years ago seemed like minutes before I found myself pulling my jacket over my shirt, reaching down to grab the strap that hung just above my right knee to keep it out of the way. As soon as it hit the underside of my thigh I realized what was happening and yanked up my zipper causing it to snap open on my pant leg, my left foot slamming backwards with every ounce of energy that remained within me and sending my whole body sprawling onto the floor.

The phone went dead in my hand as I clutched my ankle and my ears felt like they had gone soft like mush mixed with clay when everything went quiet except for my ragged breathing. I wasn’t quite sure what happened after but when I looked up the sound came rushing out again; my lungs seized with relief and panic.

A woman stood by the counter staring blankly ahead while a second stared at my mangled shoe. Her legs crossed behind her desk made sense in hind sight but not immediately as each of their bodies shifted awkwardly and uncomfortably. Then a third figure stepped forward. In fact it moved so quickly the first two must not have registered what was going on before it arrived at my feet. It sat there awkwardly and I noticed at last a couple of small fleshy protrusions between her eyebrows begin to wrinkle and spread outwards. But then they were joined in that strange way that only a woman could join two fleshy areas together and those wrinkles grew faster until they resembled something you would see between the lips of a human. And then—and then it smiled as though it had never done anything better or more wonderful than seeing my face fall flat against the marble floor.

And then both sets of lips opened wide enough to allow an inhuman roar rip through the walls of the restaurant which sent everyone’s attention towards us once more. My heart pounded in my chest so rapidly that the blood in it bubbled along the interior walls and the sound reverberated off the plastic tables to create a sort of feedback loop. The air outside was full and bright now. An enormous tentacle swept past my head and grabbed me by the shoulder gently lifting me up by my collar.

But the monstrous thing didn’t squeeze tight around my neck to snuff my life out because once again silence fell upon the restaurant. One hand pushed against the ceiling making it crack and split open while several others descended like pendulums from the roof lining the perimeter of our room. Their forms blended as a single organism and slid along the wall toward me.

The first tentacle pulled my pants leg, letting me know that I wouldn’t need to use the bathroom before we continued our journey. They were almost all dark but it wasn’t as long as I had hoped considering how strong I needed to be. They tore me upward and I landed lightly on top of the one who had picked me up and it turned slightly wider and longer in order to help me move closer to the opening and I took care to walk directly toward the edge so that I could easily stand inside without being crushed too badly.

In this moment I knew that even though this world wasn’t a nightmare anymore the one I lived in couldn’t possibly be saved and I was truly glad for once that it hadn’t always been hell. We disappeared beneath the floor but after a few moments an announcement resonated through the halls. “Oh dear lord. Another customer,”  and it took my breath away all the way to the coast of Maine because at least for a brief moment everything was alright.

There are many humans who love their family, friends, pets and romantic partners and feel that these things make life worth living.

","""You see... I had a dream."" The other half of the man said to you as he passed you a warm mug and sat down next to you at the table with an empty spot beside him. You felt like there was more he wanted to say, but you were hesitant to make him leave, or press him. 

He leaned closer and looked around ""I mean sure, it would be nice to live together here somewhere..."" He began, ""but we both know its going to take more then just getting married..."" you could tell he was going on about wanting a kid; kids had long been a sore topic between you two. In fact, *because* of your discomfort towards children - you two only dated for one month before proposing - so you weren't planning on having them any time soon either. 

""...And where did I hear that word 'marriage'?"" He raised an eyebrow at you; not that high up considering how forward he made himself look at times. 

Your mind wandered from his words, and he took the opportunity to walk all the way over to the window, closing the curtains to cover the view of the room outside. After shutting them, he turned back around. 

""Well,"" he asked you softly, taking another sip of his drink: A cuppa tea with honey. 

A pause occurred between you two. For a moment it seemed like something else entirely was happening; you couldn't quite place your finger on it. Then when you looked down at your own hands, you found what was happening... They were glowing! It wasn't anything major though. Just enough to light the candle beside you in the kitchen. 

""WOOOWWWWEEE!!!""  Fros shouted suddenly, pointing to you. You heard someone yell something under their breath, then another person shout something else, but you didn't have much time to listen anymore, because *all you thought of all night long is 'how much will this cost?'.*  The rest seemed to vanish as fast as they appeared.

","I woke up in an ice cube, and my world was made of cold blue glass and snow as far as I could see.

Then, something moved behind me.

My hand was out to grab whatever it was when I suddenly saw a small, white creature with sharp red eyes looking at me through a frozen lens. 

It growled softly, and then pulled itself together and leapt upon my shoulder and started biting me. It ran its fangs into my neck but only managed to take off what I later estimated to be 23 drops of blood before another one came over the top of me. The two creatures attacked and soon enough my body started to grow warm again...and all I could think about is how much pain I had felt.


""We are here to make a deal with you!"" the new attacker said. ""You will pay any price for your release from this prison we have built."" His voice was kind and gentle despite how terrifying the rest of his being seemed. ""Your lives will never be the same, little one, but we hope these changes can be seen as forgivable.""

The third one put its claws to my chest. He started tearing at the fabric wrapping it. ""What price shall you pay?"" he asked again, still speaking kindly.

""Please,"" I pleaded. ""If I can save anyone else, please let me try.""

The monster looked at each of us for several moments.  He finally nodded with a slow smile creeping onto his face. ""Done.""

As quickly as that happened another one appeared next to him, but this time this one was covered in spikes like our friend. Like us both, the second attacker went to claw into me, but instead, he just sunk half way into my skin and fell to the ground convulsing and writhing and screaming in agony. We were in complete shock until a figure emerged from the crowd and walked towards him, dragging him back as best as she could until everyone calmed down to the sounds of them yelling curses. I had not been able to get free of my own hands, so now there was some space between me and her and she stepped closer and closer until she grabbed the stranger by the scruff of his neck. She tossed him down toward my feet with ease and he landed softly to the freezing surface of the iceberg. That moment the monsters stopped attacking. One of them held a massive blade up in the air ready to finish the job, however, he stopped mid swing as tears flooded my cheeks and a sob escaped my lips. They hadn't meant to hurt me; why wouldn't I understand. My mind screamed at me and whispered promises of revenge. But those pleas went unanswered as my sobbing grew stronger and stronger until I could not help myself but start rolling over on my side as tears welled in my eye sockets. All the while my arm was starting to grow limp and stiff with age. What did they think of themselves, thinking that because I was a poor, innocent soul who had no friends or family and lived under a poverty line, that I would be easy prey? Maybe if they tried harder I might give them something more precious than the scraps left in my mouth after dinner. I sobbed quietly. In the midst of all my turmoil one by one all of them began to break apart. Some went right past me while other remained stationary like rocks on the icy shore of a river rushing downhill with rapid pace toward a mountain where it crashed hard against rock and split water into a thin stream of pure, unfiltered power as quickly as possible. And though we didn't last very long, even death couldn't touch me. When the remaining few gathered around me, their forms shrinking away into the shadows they crept back onto the roof where they waited patiently for me to wake. As they lifted a giant knife once again, I rose up. This time my mind told me it would be okay and fear was replaced with courage. Instead of running, I charged straight at the leader and swung my arms wide. The first strike failed and the sword sliced my flesh but missed its mark and fell into the glacier below, cracking its path along the way. Now enraged I stood tall, and pointed at each warrior and roared, 'Why?' They shook in fear as I spoke, for none dared speak words without hesitation. They slowly lowered their blades and looked straight into mine, waiting for my response. Fear gave way to anger until my face contorted into a twisted mask full of hatred and rage. With one final roar I lashed out my hands and crushed the souls of those standing in front of me. Once I finished butchering them they scattered throughout the island as fast as their legs allowed them to go. They disappeared in to a haze of smoke before leaving nothing but ash and pieces of bone. From now on these monsters would never dare step foot on sacred land. Though, it took centuries before someone decided to enter my domain ever again..

the lich summoned many powerful enemies, thus giving him access to many magic items and scrolls.

his army swept across the continent for thousands of years, and destroyed everything they touched, including entire countries.  in spite of being driven down by armies, and countless attempts at assassinations, the lich lived on, forever expanding his horde.  finally, the gods of the human pantheon created a single individual whose existence transcended even the great lich: *satan*.  for decades prior to this, satan kept growing in influence amongst the people, eventually being elected as god by popular vote (with divine power).  as he approached the lich, the lich cast a curse upon the man, forcing him to walk as if cursed by illness, and never be perceived as worthy of divine status.  but, satan accepted, and was eternally patient in his task to defeat the lich.   finally, after decades of waiting, the battle happened at mount doom, the site of the greatest battles between devil and angel.  the angels descended upon the lich army in support of satan, whilst satan himself led the charge against the lich himself.  the fight was short.  it lasted only one hour but felt like an eternity for mortals watching as an invisible hand shattered the bones of every being in sight.  an untold number of archangels and demons were killed.  but in the end, the lich was defeated, and the war in heaven ended.   after defeating all mortal beings within *humanity* alone, satan turned on his master.  he fought him the Lich for hundreds of thousand years, and finally, he prevailed.   With his master dead, satan became ruler of all realms above, which included his former master's homeland.   as he reveled in the victory, satan heard laughter coming from beneath his house.   he climbed down to where the sound came from.  there sat a group of dwarfs laughing as they drank mead.  they smiled at satan as he walked among them, drinking mead, laughing, and laughing.   that night, satan became aware of the ancient knowledge passed down between generations:  when evil dies, good also rises again.  to protect their home, the dwarves had placed an anchor deep beneath the earth into the netherworld realm, making their home eternally safe.  as satan stepped forth into the light of the sun, he was banished to the infernal regions where he languished for eons.

","I can already feel you judging me. But at least I got the job done quickly, and with minimal damage.

""This place is far too nice to have a dead body here."" I muttered as I set my helmet down. In front of me sat an open hatch, and it looked like the hatch had been open all this time as the floorboards around it rotted away. The faint smell of decay lingered within the cabin. It smelled stale; like the remnants of something rotting for years.

The snow blizzards had destroyed many parts of the farm while we were fleeing from the horde. The blizzard also broke open the tunnel leading to the cavern where the Lich dwelt, releasing what looked like a living snowball into the world. We never made it into the cave through those heavy snows and storms. That poor bastard would not make it out alive now.

His last words echoed behind me before he finally died: ""When you hear about this, you will know...that there WAS power that could bring back a lich if I am ever slain. Now go!"" The words came out weak; the poor bastard nearly choked on blood and snow, which made me think he had lost a lung or both in the attack when one of the gnolls swung down with their axe. He should be long dead now. Which means there is somewhere else out there with another frost golem, but for someone who just went against death twice to put him down.

","The wind whipped my hair around as I stood at the mouth of Red Grave Canyon. The old cemetery sat ahead of me, nestled into the hills in the fading light, an eerie quiet settling over everyone present. There were plenty of other ranchers out here hunting rabbits, but they all went their separate ways after we reached the canyon. 

“Are there any houses?” asked Frank, my hunter and friend.

I shrugged. “Probably.”

He squinted and furrowed his brow at the valley behind us. As soon as he made eye contact with me, both men began to walk up slowly to each other. Their lips parted slightly. A moment passed, then…nothing again. They didn’t know what else to do. Frank kicked me from behind. He was now just inches away. I could hear his breathing fast approaching. Then he turned, pulled me gently by the waist down to ground level and handed me an elk leg. He took a piece off the bone with a knife sharp enough to be used for chopping wood. Before chewing on it, he glanced up and stared. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked nervously. He waved me over toward his rifle.

We spent three days before reaching the top of Red Grave Canyon. We found what looked like animal remains scattered amongst the trees on either side of us, rotting under a thick layer of dirt. It seemed as if hundreds of dead animals lay upon us. But what startled us the most was how many human bones lay scattered throughout. 

After eating the rest of Frank’s elk, we packed our rifles and gear, and set up camp beneath a massive juniper tree. From where I stood at that point, I watched the sun setting behind us, as if the whole world had been sucked flat through time. It reminded me of those night-time shows people would enjoy on TV back home; I always thought one day I’d live amongst the stars. I felt a sudden sadness and ran into the woods to relieve myself. That’s when I heard it: laughing!

“Come on,” I said to someone standing close to me but never seen by any of the others beside me. When we got within thirty feet of the sound, it stopped. Our mouths dried up, hands trembled, sweat coated our brows - a sense of fear engulfed the four of us who stood so silently by the base of the trees. 

Then we heard another soft laugh come out from beneath the earth itself. “Where are you!” shouted Mr. Smith. Everyone jumped. And then we saw him. He stood up and walked towards us, smiling. But something wasn’t right. His left arm dangled loosely at his side and he was missing his head, wearing no gloves or hat of any kind but a cheap chain. Where the top of his head should be, we now saw a mass of red flesh covered in dark red lines and blotches. “Can’t leave this thing behind,"" chuckled Mr. Smith, gesturing to himself with an arm held aloft.


When Mr. Smith opened his mouth to speak, a low groan ripped past the trees, silencing every person standing near and drawing blood from Mr. Smiht’s cheek. He closed his mouth and wiped the blood away, staring up, wide eyed, as the red mass grew larger. One minute passed, five minutes passed, two seconds passed, ten minutes passed. This thing had grown so large as to block half of the road, and its skin resembled that of a spider instead of flesh. With each passing second that passed, our limbs became more numb. All that can be heard was Mr. Smith speaking, his voice raspy at first; then high pitched.

Mr. Smith coughed loudly, taking several gasps as he spoke. “Go. Get outta here. Leave this place. No matter how long it takes you. Hurry!”

184,"Upon entering a ghost town, you have a feeling that you're not alone.
","The sun beat down on the dilapidated buildings of Deadwater Gulch, baking the air even as the sky turned dark and brooding before rain began to fall.  In 1972, a small town vanished in one day with no indication of what happened to them or where they went. One day after a family moving in found their house was built over an old mine shaft, things got odd...

The first sign of anything being amiss came when a boy walking through the forest nearby reported hearing his mom yelling for him to get away from something. It sounded like she said 'run!' but he wasn't familiar with his mother's vocabulary and so didn't quite make out the word correctly. When he finally returned home that day, his mom was sitting on her own porch watching TV. He asked if there had been any trouble while he was gone and she just replied ""No honey, nothing at all"". Something seemed off, she was acting awfully weird; as though she didn't believe him, and his mom never lied. She then left without speaking again.  His brother was also upset by this experience, and kept mentioning how he saw things moving around in the woods. They were strange shadowy figures and they appeared to move in quick ways, which he couldn't explain.

Later on a group of friends decided it was worth finding out what really was going on, leaving little clues along their route - such as placing their shoes strategically next to some trees where leaves had fallen. This did, however, seem to only lead them deeper into the unknown, not further ahead. After a few days of hunting, one of the people called back saying ""I see what I think is the cause"". What appeared to be footprints made from bone covered sticks were scattered across the path, and they were huge! Enough to fit a person with ease. 

As each week passed more hikers walked along the trails, eventually leading their way to a deserted street lined by identical houses in perfect order. In front of them stood two men; tall and wiry in appearance. Before them lay four other men, faces twisted in fright. The hikers immediately charged forward with anger building among them, ready to fight these monsters but stopped themselves when an even larger monster emerged from behind them holding six dead bodies tied around their necks with thick rope. His head lifted, looking directly at the walkers and shouting through the wind and rain, ""IT WAS ME! MY OWN GRANDSON DID THIS!"". The sound echoed forever after their shock, and they slowly retreated to find aid. As fast as they ran they weren't safe. It would only be another day before two armed men burst into the house they hid at, and put guns to everyones heads demanding answers. What should have been a simple task took hours because there was no one else on campus yet, so they decided to call the police.

When the police arrived, they asked questions and listened to what had transpired. When finished, Officer Davis pulled his gun out and pointed it right at the leader who demanded to be heard, ""Why isn't everyone here?! Is your kid still in school? Why aren't WE in school?"". There was silence amongst the gang leaders and the officer continued, now getting louder, ""ANSWER MY QUESTION!"" No response came. ""I HAVE A GUN!!"" screamed the officer, pointing the weapon at the group. The response was quiet once again. All except for one man. Behind a pair of large rocks, a figure stepped out, eyes glowing brightly as he looked out at the group. ""THE POLICE ARE NOT THE ANSWER"" shouted the demon with a single hand clawing towards the cops, forcing them to run for cover. More screams rang throughout the night, as the body count rose beyond counting. Days later when the story began to travel, no answer could come. Not until death itself claimed the perpetrator. But now we know why: Death is coming to take us all.

","I came from the wrong side of 60% and knew to watch your step when driving through Ghost Town but I just felt like I was on another planet, maybe in some strange purgatory where people are forever damned and no one will leave until we figure it out or something. There were ghosts and demons all over, if they weren’t the ones trying to eat your soul then they had their own way of trying to kill you off before hand, but by watching around every corner and into every window I found nothing.

Nothing until I rounded one block and saw what appeared to be two women arguing between themselves by a light fountain statue, I stopped and tried to listen more closely, it sounded almost like a conversation. It wasn’t exactly an intelligent discourse though - “You can’t eat him! He is my property!” Said the first woman, her voice being choked up as she screamed at the top of her lungs, there was probably nowhere else to go to avoid running into a wall except away from the two of them so I turned in other direction thinking this might help me catch whatever made this place so creepy.

As soon as I did that I heard footsteps approaching behind me so I decided to turn slowly and quickly. In doing so I saw them both jump towards each other as if caught in some sort of trance, looking down into my face they looked back and forth from left to right and then to mine again. They gave me a few knowing smiles as if I understood the unspoken language of death and spoke aloud “Do you wanna die? We can do it quick...” said one of the women.

Before I could even speak I reached for my purse in hopes that I had a lighter handy or some sort of weapon and I pulled it out, only to find it was empty because I ran with my family earlier and hid our money somewhere in the house, they must have followed us since I never noticed anyone else walking on foot. One looked me directly in the eye and said “Of course honey...you should come inside now, your children don’t have much time left. You can help too.” She gestured back to the statue but instead it seemed warped, its body twisted and deformed in a manner similar to how people look after the fall.

I thought they were coming closer to me but somehow the water fountain appeared above us as soon as I took my hands out to grab the base, then started making noise, as always whenever it broke free from its perch for any reason. The sound seemed to shake the ground beneath my feet and caused one of the ladies to cough up blood which splashed onto the ground and stained white. The ice cream man said calmly “Come along now” to lead me away from there. I backed away slowly as fast as I could while still watching my feet under me because I had been born and raised by a loving mom who taught me when to drive safely and I couldn’t afford to trip and run full speed into those sharp glass shards littering the streets below me. When I looked back the statues head had fallen to the ground revealing the ice cream guy whose clothes and facial features shifted from normal to human. All of his friends froze, their lips opening as though they didn’t understand why he had done that either, the man smiled down at me as he spoke to me in a friendly tone, “Welcome to Ghost Town, dearie.”


If these characters are indeed ghosts and zombies you can tell me why they did anything differently here. If they are neither, please tell me their names and species and what other anomalies happened in the timeline.

","""God dammit!  Not another freaking ghost!"" She snapped again and began to walk away from the wall once more, shaking her head at the ghostly being for some unknown crime against society. ""Seriously? It's like he keeps it all locked up so no one has access and then when I go looking for something in there he shows himself every other day just to give me an annoying runaround.

I knew she could be a pain in my ass but I couldn't blame her on how rude she was because as far as our friends had gotten us out of this mess we might very well never see each other for a while. We were stranded here about six months ago after escaping from the government compound. All sorts of shit started happening ever since we got here. First it was the robots who came alive by magic and tried to kill everyone or those robot dogs made it worse with their creepy barker bitchslapping our asses before they decided to bite. Of course they weren't doing such work now since one of them went off script and turned around the army after getting shot twice right to his asshole which meant that even the military decided enough was enough and moved the hell out of here, leaving most of us behind. There were more problems than people though but we thought we survived and somehow found ourselves wandering through this valley until... well basically like your story said, finding this dumb fucking ghost making stupid decisions.

","I had arrived at my classroom with a plan: “How does one go from ‘Rump’ to ‘Ruma’? Can we teach ourselves? Does grammar even mean anything?” It seemed like a fair place to start but I shouldn’t have used our usual textbook as a whiteboard.

We were supposed to make new vocab lists and try to come up with definitions, but the undead didn’t seem interested in words or concepts. They seemed more interested in flesh. 

It had started innocently enough: The sounds of shuffling, moans, groans. Then the rotting stench that permeated every square inch of the room where they congregrated. Then there he stood. He stood staring over the bodies slumped on the floor, all groaning and moaning. And right before him was the dead man’s pen which his face lingered upon for what felt like eternity. We all heard him chuckle softly when he put the pen down; then he turned around and began to cough until some phlegm escaped his mouth to drip down his chin and onto the desk next to him. His eyes locked upon mine through the bloodshot cracks between his teeth. How did this happen? Had I ever actually given birth? Was there a reason he stared at me? Would I survive this? No one answered. What will happen to us? No one knew; why are we here? When will we find out?

Well after a little while I gave up on trying to figure things out and decided instead to focus on the ones sitting up and watching everyone else slowly lose consciousness. They looked very happy. My classmates started talking about how excited they were going to be at home and I realized that nobody cared what was happening to me or the rest of us anymore. Nobody cared if we survived or not. But hey, whatever! It is only the most fun day of the week anyway. At least that’s what my best friend said when he came barging into class screaming that there wasn’t time to waste and that we should do nothing less than jump-start our classes so nobody gets left behind.

","The first thing I noticed as the two towering figures of flesh and bone came closer, were that they looked exactly like the human teachers in my school, but somehow much worse.

They'd come from behind me - I had finally managed to get a bit too deep into a conversation about Edgar Allen Poe's 'Raven', and therefore completely zoned out until I realized something rather strange. One could assume that even if people do not have any common ground besides the most basic knowledge of reading and writing, at least this should be true. In my situation, however, was one of the rare exceptions. The zombie-teacher stared at him like a predator stares at a mouse.

I knew there was no real use for words anymore, neither did I see any real use for gestures other than that of shaking hands or bumping your head against each others skulls repeatedly (with varying degrees of force). Instead, what I did in those moments, was simply think. Think whatever thought I needed to escape. And so, despite his attempts to scare the life out of me with a slow lumbering and deafening roar, I managed to reason the entire way back to my office. By then, though, the rest of my class was already huddled under desks. I made sure to grab every single book on our curriculum before heading towards my home. It took almost three hours to reach home. My parents saw off the undead beast which appeared on our door after only five minutes, sending a loud scream through the hall and alerting everyone nearby.

","The air hung heavy with tension as I hunched over the pile of crumpled papers in front of me. We had only gotten one day in writing class at this point.

My mouth ran dry and my throat hurt after swallowing 25 different things in each lesson - not really good eating habits for those of us still alive. They did bring coffee though, which they kept on ice to keep cool. That is unless someone drank out of it before it even got there. Then they just threw away the whole cup because it was ""all hot already"". Apparently being cold helps. Even if your head isn't. Which mine most definitely wasn't anymore than normal. They said that drinking water would help but it felt like trying to drink acid. Nothing went well here.

They told us we were safe. Of course that was fine when most of us could move around freely and not be attacked from all sides while wearing only underwear and socks, or shoes/sandals and jackets (I didn't know how they figured we'd wear shirts). This classroom was full of other english teachers too. It wasn't like any other public school that hadn't had an outbreak yet, so they knew they wouldn't kill them immediately. At least not until they got back home alone anyway. Some of our students must have escaped the zombie attack, some of them were sent to hospitals or shelters. But ours stayed behind to help save the rest. Some volunteers came into help, too. Though I noticed they always left almost immediately once the new teacher made it known what happened. No explanation, never asked about our condition either, no thanks. Just gone like the old volunteer teachers that came in last month!

As long as it meant more english practice for the future generation that is. If we survived that is.

Now we weren't exactly able to talk much though. Not much at all. The last thing I remembered doing before I woke up was opening the door during first period after seeing something scrawled across my door - DON'T DEAD OPEN INSIDE! In block letters big enough to easily read from my doorway. I remember coming down the hall feeling sick. What else could it mean? I had called another english teacher, Karen. She took her class into the hallway where she let them do various writing prompts since the power was still on in the classrooms. After I saw her I went into the office instead. When I found Ms. Jenkins locked out, I sat back down by the window where the sun rose above my doorway every day. There are many sunny days to come, I thought. And soon, there will be a new group of brave young minds entering these halls for the fall. Maybe tomorrow will be different.

","“Good morning class, welcome back!”

An undead hand shoots through my body and rips out my organs before pulling its own mouth down over them in order to cover up your wounds when they bleed and grow worse thanks to the light that leaks in from the windows of your office. 

After having a very rough experience with the last “lesson” I give you some guidelines for your future lessons so nobody gets hurt: 1) no blood or bodily fluids need to be released during class as this will make you more difficult to clean up; 2) do not eat while teaching; 3) if there is something left over from dinner just throw it away, thank god we are only in January; 4) bring enough water to survive three days. 

You walk through the door of your high school classroom at the beginning of each day looking for signs you might die on yourself, and I mean actual dead signs like yours should read “DON’T TOUCH ME”, not the stupid little sign behind your name tag.


I am grateful I could see what my current pupils wrote because a few of them really wanted to murder me on the first lesson I had. One even tried to strangle me after I told him his sentence structure sucked.



A zombie hands drop right onto the table and tears open your eyelids so he can get a look into your soul. “So sir,” he says calmly, “Do you have any writing tips?”



After making sure everything is still there so there aren’t any distractions in the room when someone tries to stab me, I start talking about punctuation marks. This seems like an easy way to distract them and possibly earn myself life with all these extra supplies that I received when Mr. Henderson died last year, as soon as we get outside I try to stab one right here under my skin because I believe I am going to go crazy inside a locked classroom while I teach these children every bloody day until Mr. Henderson comes home from his vacation.



And then they would become my friends but i don’t think I wanna spend eternity learning to write sentences while surrounded by my killer classmates, and since I can’t live another 90 years without eating flesh again, it seems like it’s either kill or be killed.



I know if I kill a living human instead of the brain-eating monster that lurks inside of my mind I’ll probably receive one of those special prizes that teachers get when they finish a tenure contract plus a raise from the principal and they let us go whenever they feel like it. And trust me I wish I did!

186,"""Allies, Enemies? Let us set our differences aside.""
[removed]","You are an agent of the Intergalactic Council for Earth. In 2438, aliens first appeared on Earth by spaceship from a distant planet that was dying. They contacted you because humans and aliens were now in conflict with each other over resources which were running scarce as they both tried to defend their home planets against invasion from each other (since we aren't going to get any assistance from them or their allies). Thus, this group has been sent here to assist the warring factions while humanity decides whether to go into full war with one another (as a second attempt to kill off everyone) or work together with the alien race if they do not come in peace (if they came by ship) but I don't think there is much point since neither will happen anyway, let's just assume we don't have anyone to save.

You had heard all about them before, and after having arrived from your dead world, met the interdimensional beings who took over earth as well as killed millions upon billions over you did finally meet them and tell them what happened:

- ""Our people fought back"" you said as they began laying waste to everything including you, your family (who you barely knew), friends and pets - anything left standing. You felt nothing when you witnessed death for too long, or rather, *everything* started growing numb and gray around you until finally, there wasn't any difference between seeing two soldiers die versus a tree, a dog, your cat - they were all merely insects compared to the true enemy: you (and your kind) could see death coming, so you decided it best to fight back only at certain times where things would be able to become worse than the norm. However after being chased and almost hunted down, a few thousand of your survivors formed a new religion dedicated to the worship of death itself; you called yourself *Mortens*. Mortals became the god worshipped amongst *Mortens,* and those who would wage holy war against the undead (those who died defending themselves), would earn passage to his kingdom, while those killed by other mortals who would join Mortens would be judged and brought to hell to roam forever within its depths (not literally, however). Even today, every mortal in a battle against an undead warrior would pray to Mortes - usually to appease him and prevent your wrath upon them in case they fail to bring you glory and death to the invaders. The Mortons eventually discovered why the invaders took over *their* world: humans attacked their own planet (which was also slowly turning grey). So, Morten invaded and killed all remaining mortal races as well as the aliens, who were still trying to live out there day. Since nobody else stood up to Morten yet and he continued to attack more worlds to take over for the entertainment he derived through destroying all those he saw (except for his servants - of which he greatly admired/disliked) Morten wanted to use Earth as an extra source of fuel to grow stronger, but then *this person appears.* The news of his tyranny is quickly reported throughout the universe and many groups begin attempting to contact the 'true' God (morten himself), offering themselves for his service while others simply try to sabotage him like *humans* always do. As the leader of Mortens I hear *millions of voices crying for mercy as they beg Morten to spare them.* Now your choice: remain seated and listen patiently as those *pitiful mortals* plead for forgiveness with no hope at all nor faith; pray to them before the end so you can go to heaven and leave with your brethren... Or stand up and walk away to safety, leaving these creatures to rot further below the eyes of god above. It's entirely yours to decide how Mortens ends!


Now, choose wisely.

It sounded so reasonable. They all agreed to it in the end after an impassioned argument that lasted for hours upon hours. The meeting was organized by an alien lifeform who knew of the great war between humans and aliens and had hoped to use the tension to his advantage to bring peace. In actuality he would have preferred a stalemate as even with the best technology on either side there seemed to be no clear victor over the other unless each side suffered a huge setback or death toll. Unfortunately, this was more difficult than expected given both sides were not willing to make any sort of concessions and instead dug themselves deeper into their respective positions when the negotiation team called to set up another round of talks. It took weeks before negotiations resumed at which time they were held in a tense standoff of arguments where one word could swing a match in their favor. When these words came back across space the Alien leader sighed knowing he would soon face a stalemate or full blown war regardless of what he said. He had been negotiating for 20 years to prevent such a state of affairs for 300 billion lightyears and all he had gotten were threats. So he told them all; ""Let's play chess.""

No one wanted to move first, but slowly they all gave in

Humans made for aggressive expansionism - taking land/resources from others - therefore aggression, surprise attacks, treachery and espionage were often preferred methods - while many aliens preferred stealthy strikes, infiltration and covert action, using mental domination via psychic powers, mind control, advanced camouflage (to blend in) etc... 
They found out how similar their tactics were, however, just as much as they thought the opposite to be true.  That was a point where some began to realize that perhaps, just possibly, they were dealing with someone whose intelligence exceeded theirs

So no one wanted to move first. And slowly, all fell silent except the human commander: ""I declare forfeit.""

Some of the soldiers in my squad held their weapons and glared at me. I had only ever heard them say “Enemy” until today; some other time they’d probably just shot me to death without a second thought. At that time, nobody cared about any alliances or treaties - only killing someone who showed up on your territory was enough for conflict. These people were different: these humans, we fought side-by-side when things were difficult, and now it seemed there wasn’t much more of an enemy between us than what remained after the battle we had fought.

After we landed near here, everybody put down their guns and turned to look at each other, even if not knowing why anybody else would be interested in what others have to say about how much of an enemy you are for having taken over another country before. Even though most of us hadn’t known each other much longer than twenty minutes, some of us managed to shake hands with our former foes and start talking. As such, we decided to continue speaking among ourselves and eventually settled down as an unlikely group of friends. 

“Why did you attack?” A soldier asked. He was tall, strong - one of my old squadmates who I had lost somewhere during combat; he looked like his body still remembered many times he’d been on a military base back home. He was part of my original squad. If not for his help and willingness to believe I wouldn’t betray him so soon, I might have died out here long ago. 

“You were afraid,” Another soldier said. There was no doubt about it anymore: she knew more of me than I did of myself. She’d made sure nobody believed otherwise by staring right through me during our training when I told everyone I couldn’t trust any other man - which had angered me at first, but helped her establish trust from day one. We talked like this every night while waiting to launch a mission. It felt strange, but all those years spent fighting together, learning to trust each other with information nobody would understand unless they weren’t supposed to know something, somehow meant a lot more to us than words could describe.

A short time later all of us got to see just why none of us attacked our allies. We went outside and stood along the hilltop together - seeing both sides of the line between countries, some of which looked surprisingly similar because I’m pretty sure one of the reason we weren’t at war for a few centuries was that they didn’t want to fight against each other either. Nobody had wanted to attack anyone since the last major world war started - we never had to really think twice when attacking another. Now that was different. Seeing the lines dividing our countries reminded me how little difference existed - except for the color of some uniforms and whether a certain symbol adorned them. We saw the same mountains behind our troops, we saw the same water flow past and under them and saw the same crops growing out in front of them - our cultures had barely changed at all beyond technology and resources used to be used compared to our previous civilization. The soldiers beside me shared this view and gave high five after high five, sometimes to cheers and laughter, and occasionally yelling “Dude, bro! That’s my man!” to each other. They came from the army where our current leader was born, trained at bootcamp there - apparently a place called Korea. Their division into North and South was exactly the way they had lived through their childhood, and their own country split after an almost total loss in manpower during their youth; the two factions united once more after the Korean War. One thing I hadn’t expected, however, was that they still used the English alphabet - at least for most communication. Apparently they adopted it to help their younger brother, North Korea, learn faster when they needed to communicate. When we spoke, we found out how they actually had taught each other their languages; that some Korean terms translated into English better than anything else and vice versa, and learned from each other language slowly and methodically. It had worked amazingly well and created some sort of unique hybrid language called Hangul. They also agreed upon sharing our alphabet as a goodwill gesture and helping teach other groups new ways to understand each other even further - creating several intercommunication channels between our three branches. It’d taken months for me to find out their language, given its unusual mixture of English letters and Chinese pronunciation, but once I had finally deciphered it thanks to countless practice sessions in their camp, I figured it wasn’t too hard to do for them - I just couldn’t quite figure out why some of the writing looked a bit familiar…

When we all shook hands with each other again and headed back into the buildings, one of my soldiers yelled to me, ""That’s weird. Why does this letter look familiar?""

","I knew it was going wrong the moment that dude in a black suit pulled up beside us. It was like one of those cheap horror movies but without any plot... I mean sure we were all dressed out looking normal enough but why did he pull off his sunglasses when he came over? ""Hey man, sorry 'bout this busted bus"" he said holding his glass up in apology after I rolled my window down. He had a thick Russian accent as well which added some credibility to the whole situation, I guess?

""Yeah no worries brah"" I said chuckling. ""Whatcha got there?""  He pointed at the bus driver who stared back at him, confused, hands clenched. I looked out to see where we'd parked the last half block earlier and then went back to look at the driver with a questioning eyebrow raise. Dude was probably getting nervous or something because he just shrugged his shoulders sheepishly.

It took me about ten seconds to decide whether or not I wanted to believe this guy right here. The most interesting thing I've ever heard, and only in my high school English class did we learn what Ivan(ov) actually meant, and that sounded exactly how this guy acted too. This guy's clothes were pretty old fashioned for any fashionably inclined American teenager too. That could be our ticket right there - they aren't much into black anymore these days? Then again his hair wasn't too modern either.

The first step I really did take toward joining the Russians was trying to get a better look around the rest of them. ""Alex, do you have any kids?"" We've been driving across New Mexico since around noon and haven't seen an actual person outside of the bus company staff for over four hours so now everyone is kind of acting suspicious about strangers. Maybe we should've done another search around the luggage area and found a map while still locked up in Idaho instead of eating our donuts. 

And the bus itself started groaning a lot, every five feet or so from where we passed through towns. ""Hey Alex do you have any family?"" We all chimed in, our voices echoing from behind the cracked bus windows. Some of us even held up our phones or tablets recording on youtube style footage. Sure that would look cool online but if someone saw us doing that when Alex was giving us advice maybe his plan wouldn't work after all.

We had stopped at some tourist trap along the way before entering the woods just a little while ago, when our bus driver informed us all of the fact we would now be delayed due to mechanical problems until further notice. My friends were arguing amongst themselves about what they should do when, out of nowhere, it came to me like lightning from god himself. I knew exactly where he needed us to go so naturally I pointed them toward a dirt track off of his map. ""There's a path here. You can see it from the top,"" said Sarah.

Soon after though people began asking why we couldn't take that route back. We soon found ourselves wandering deeper and deeper into the woods as our hope grew dimmer. Eventually we realized there wasn't any signs or markings on the ground, or on walls or anything for that matter. It seemed to be an ancient forest that had not been altered or mapped over time.

But more than anything else it was the stillness that did us in. A few miles deep we heard nothing but the sound of birds chirping and something resembling footsteps. Just long enough for us to feel brave enough to turn our heads towards the source but quick enough so as to avoid meeting his eyes. We turned but our courage proved too fickle because then he screamed out loud to let me know he could see us. We bolted past him without even looking back until we reached this clearing. There we noticed that the ground we stood on didn't look that different, nor was there anything else noticeable beyond trees and the sounds of birds tweeting. But he said we were deep within a forbidden forest. That anyone who has entered is never seen again. So we got together and decided to try finding our way out of this place ourselves... which we thought would have been fairly easy after having left his company.


""I am sorry."" A deep booming voice announced behind us.""It is my deepest regret that this is happening... but I want to invite you inside."" ""No! You have stolen our freedom through manipulation and now fear and misery will keep us from leaving!"" All the friends yelled almost simultaneously. He looked confused momentarily before yelling back. ""What? I gave you a chance to leave... it doesn't work that way."" Another wave of confusion swept over them as they realised how ignorant he was and started marching around the clearing and circling round him in mockery. ""If you give us choices between death or slavery how can your offer of comfort and safety come free! WE ARE HERE IN PRISON!! WHERE IS THE GATE!? TELL US OR WE WILL BE JOINED BY THE GROWN-UPS!!!"" The group shouted all in unison. Before he could process their demands another voice boomed out in the distance...",3.1875,0.2021484375,0.1962890625

","It was the first time I'd been this far out into the wilderness.  After having only seen small settlements like the one that housed our friends home for many months, we hadn't really had anything remotely resembling nature. At least no natural things had come close to being what is considered ""wild""

I didn't need an axe or pickax but I did want more than just wood to build a shelter. I needed branches as thick as my thigh and large enough to make sure there were plenty of rooms. In addition I wanted lumber so sturdy it could withstand weather conditions. It would be helpful if this could also make good windows at least a couple meters wide but that wasn't necessarily necessary. After all some form of sunlight would still fall within reach even through branches, making it easier for us to see from our location.

With each day passing I felt I was getting closer and closer to my goal of reaching the clearing where people often spoke about ""nature"" . That forest had always appeared on maps but there seemed to be less than half a dozen people who had actually ventured there. Despite its beauty however nobody talked much about venturing there, either because they knew how dangerous it truly was or they simply feared the stories that others told. I personally believed something happened there, something that resulted in those individuals never coming back. Perhaps it was their families that stayed behind or perhaps it was more serious, though to me the former sounded like the safer option.

What brought me back towards the destination today were other hikers. They came near almost every morning which was fine; after all they wouldn't talk much and would usually leave before dark. To them, they just looked as lost as most of us and possibly more desperate since their eyes were red with tired eyes despite trying to sleep off their fatigue. With each sunrise, though, another hiker was gone from the path and sometimes several more depending on how many were found unconscious. Today only two remained yet even as the sun dipped below horizon these two continued to walk. It should have given cause for alarm but I took comfort that they would hopefully keep moving until they got to civilisation where maybe one of their parties might find the injured party among them in the woods, but alas hope turned out to be false as those words would soon ring hollow from everyone except for myself and only one other remaining hiker.

","The air in the car was heavy, full of anticipation. Each one of us could smell the freshly brewed coffee brewing within minutes; my friend Alex had insisted we take a quick sip at a roadside coffee stall while he drove from the big city to our destination resort for a weekend getaway. The sun hadn't been setting too long yet so the sky overhead still bore an orange tinge that seemed surreal as I looked at it. It felt very peaceful out there.

We stopped at that coffee shop after driving for a good hour or more through a small town that felt less like real town than some tourist trap along Interstate Highway 95. One thing we did notice though, is that many of these towns don’t feel much different since they were built centuries ago. They look as though they should be from the past; nothing but brick houses, cobblestones, and crooked trees reaching towards the sunset just south of where you stand. We parked the car and got off only to walk towards the store as soon as Alex returned to us with a cup of coffee each.

“I love how much nature has changed over centuries” I said aloud. Alex chuckled and sipped his drink. “What do you mean? You can tell time has passed even by looking outside?” I shook my head slightly at him before continuing.

“No—what I mean is what I see here. Look.” As if by magic, every single branch on a tree seemed as though they were growing thicker and heavier. Trees appeared as though they were slowly expanding themselves further into existence right before my eyes. I almost jumped back as the asphalt road in front of me disappeared until all that remained was green grass that took up the width of three lanes and ran toward the horizon behind which I saw only pine trees and woods. It felt strangely safe, and for some reason the wind wasn’t exactly chilly as well. My senses felt heightened now for no reason why, so much so that my vision felt clearer in a weird sense. A voice called out to us, startling me.

“Why did I have to go that far…” I heard a deep sigh right beside me and I realized it must have come from Alex who stepped backward slightly when he spoke. The light reflected in his dark brown eyes that had grown closer together making them less distinct than usual. All thoughts of the bizarre events I witnessed vanished as I gazed closely at Alex. His clothes were different in a peculiar sense as well, they appeared less worn compared to normal wear despite seeming new. I couldn’t believe it...my feet were stepping on dirt.

“There!” Alex pointed a finger ahead; whatever sound had caused me to blink suddenly made its presence known again, louder this time, and I instinctively turned to face the source of the noise. Two words echoed throughout the forest surrounding us— ‘Beware the forest!’. For once I had wished I wore earplugs because my ears started ringing as I turned around slowly then froze myself mid-motion. Behind us stood a man whose silhouette seemed darker than the rest as if night itself were somehow contained within him. He tilted his hat over his eyes and smiled as if to acknowledge our presence. It seemed impossible but his body stayed motionless, arms folded behind him and knees bent a little. In front of him stood half of our party in their perfect attire matching the environment - most likely casual outfits for hiking, wearing backpacks and shorts etc.—still oblivious to their surroundings. Before they went in front of the mysterious man. Something felt wrong about this. Was it the fact that we had gotten off-route or something else?

The voice resumed speaking, “So you have found yourselves here. Welcome.” No matter what happened or how we got there I knew we would never make it home. Alex had walked forward with my other friends behind him as always. With no warning those left standing were ourselves, having already walked beyond the perimeter of his own group. Alex placed a hand out to shake our shoulders gently reminding us to smile. Even though his tone sounded calm he had a stoicism that seemed unnatural. Still shaking hands with everyone but mine he grinned and gestured forward into the dense forest. There stood a large log that looked like some type of throne judging by its shape, upon the end sat another stranger clad in shining armor. That must’ve been the person responsible for yelling that message. I was sure it hadn’t been part of anyone’s original plans to be summoned directly into the forest during the first week of summer. But they must have been here longer than expected—like really, *really* long. I watched anxiously as each of the friends stood before the soldier in order. Soon it was only 2 of us standing under the same shade as the people waiting for their turn.  One question lingered in the air between both parties; why hadn’t they run yet?

It had nothing to do with the fact that there’s another you living life on Earth right now as me.

It didn’t matter because even when I died you got a chance to live again thanks to your god. You couldn’t figure out why your mother killed herself before my funeral though. And honestly neither could I until she told me.

“I was afraid you would die,” she said, choking back tears on my wedding day “And so after her husband passed away all alone without any children or anyone but me he was so lonely that I decided if she didn’t love me enough to kill me too”

No wonder she was so sad. She probably thought I deserved it for what I did. My father gave up the entirety of his life for our family yet for some reason every time something happened to him it would always be her fault. There were arguments over who kept her company while the other was out fighting monsters. No one understood how happy we were at first then there weren’t. The last words to leave her mouth weren’t mine.

Anyway back to *you*! Oh boy here it goes again. What was it this time? Oh yes I died again. The best part was getting a second chance. If my brother hadn’t saved me at the very end from a meteor shower it wouldn’t have happened! In essence you only get a new life because you made an impact upon the earth like the previous lifetimes! That must mean by now that my mom and dad will be coming for us in due time huh? So exciting! But whatever let me go off topic. I’ve never found an excuse to not talk to my parents about this anyway since everyone else does.

They really aren’t that cool when you think about it:

• They just sit on their thrones bored of everything. Watching everyone suffer to come down and play games with them. Sometimes if you can solve one of their riddles they get to come over and hang out with you but usually they don’t bother. Then you have to keep doing it all over again when their game gets too hard. Seems pretty unfair, wouldn’t you say? Also they rarely ever tell you anything useful either. Like where’s this monster world? Where’s the water? Are humans stupid and annoying because they make a huge mistake called global warming?? Well guess who has to fix this mess you guys have created?! It’s *you!*

• Oh yeah don’t forget that time you were walking through a haunted forest and one of your friends decided he needed protection because he wanted to hold his girlfriend's hand which totally sucked. Apparently that was when the spirits started summoning themselves into reality. Yeah I’m laughing and I’m dead sorry I don’t know why but it was hilarious! Sorry I hope you didn’t laugh too. Even if you didn’t understand that story most people do! Maybe those ghosts actually summoned you here!!!

","Everyone has their one shot at death and I was just getting my first time going.

It wasn't a good day for me. I had woken up from my nightly sleep in the middle of an intense thunderstorm; there was only one way out; the window which, being over fifty years old by that point, I don't expect would be much help with the wind trying to get in it. With trembling hands I gripped onto the window ledge before sliding down until I got to a nice soft pile on carpet below it.

Then, out came him. He went straight over to that bed, he looked like an asshole if we were being honest but hey everybody looks stupid when you do it for too long, took the blanket off the top and jumped over to the other side. I wouldn't have thought anything of it had he not taken a knife or what ever he pulled outta his pocket out and begun to lay it across my face. It felt like a thousand pins stuck into my eyelids; I tried desperately to squint my eyes shut to avoid more stabbing but as soon as I did so I heard the noise. ""Hey man why are you yelling? You hear what I said."" A voice sounded through the room followed by a loud crash and then silence. ""Man I told you to stay away from my girl"" now all I could think about was that damn sound; it never seemed to stop echoing from the other side. My vision got clearer slowly, the pain left but something else started to settle; this was all real and I really needed to get back outside. Carefully crawled over to get outta the house and threw myself past the front gate before hearing another crash ""whoooo boy! Now who am I gonna kill tonight?"" *thump*....it was coming for me again. That fucking thunder kept crashing along with every groan of 'death'.

","The pain was almost immediate and agonizing; but as the light grew brighter and my body relaxed I slowly realized the worst pain of all... that of a being forgotten by life.

Then again it seems like today was bad luck... because for the last two hundred years or so, no one has remembered me. That is to say... until now. It is nice to make an impact on something that isn't you. Though if this were to work out, would anyone be able to take care of everyone else? No need to get political with these matters as the human race will cease to exist, at least that's what happened before. The pain fades from your senses, there's no real reason to waste time thinking of things past since you can't do anything about them anyway. Now just let fate decide...

It seemed he had been trying his best to give up. Every day for months he tried to murder me in various ways - stabbings, shootings, explosions and bombings. I know not why he did this, but it wasn't very difficult to convince him that killing me had nothing to do with me, rather than any other individual he might be attempting to kill. He could have simply shot himself, but he never thought of doing so; well perhaps only because of what he might become - a ghost who haunts everyone who lives in their home.

I noticed his attempts of murder growing less frequent over the course of time - he began making sure to keep people around him, as suicide meant I wouldn't have killed him. One man couldn't possibly escape this trap forever. This new person stayed for quite a while, though not long enough for me to really feel it (at this point anyways). There seemed to be some kind of odd sense of security he gave off as well - as if nothing could happen. Though after many years he eventually decided suicide was more appealing, even though I didn't expect it at all.

Well here I sit, alone in the void - surrounded by darkness. My bones creak softly, as if they don't mind having a place they call home. The end. You see, you cannot tell when you are going to die, and yet it feels much better to be dead than alive once you notice this. But at the same time those who don't notice may die in vain, wanting to live a life they won't be able to have anymore.

","She stood frozen, paralyzed by fear as the assassin charged at her through the shimmering mist of smoke-filled halls, a wicked grin plastered across his face as he swung his blade through the air. 

At this moment, I decided to let out a gasp for breath. At that very same moment, one of my arrows flew from its bowstring at full speed toward him. She looked down, eyes closed as she took an oath that would forever bind me to those words: ""I will kill you.""

""Please!"" He said, turning away before the blade found its mark. Turning back again, he stared at his own hand and laughed. It seemed absurd; he knew that her arrow would hit her target soon enough, and yet he still called to it. Her blade sang and danced around his body like a deadly swan as he fell to his knees. Still holding up his last hope, he turned back to her, but all she did was stare at him as tears welled up in her eyes.

""Thank you, thank you,"" she whispered. With trembling hands, he reached out toward hers in acceptance and peace. Their fingers laced together; they were so strong and beautiful that she could barely bear it, and the weightlessness of relief swept her into an embrace of such beauty that she couldn't control herself. In doing so, she lost sight of me--the man who had been killing her in vain throughout the whole ordeal.

","*I do not own the rights to Harry Potter or any of its characters, all I have is my imagination.*

""Ugh, I hate you!"" Draco spat as he was being dragged into Dumbledore's office. 

Draco didn't think this would happen to him either, the last thing he expected after having accidentally poisoned Snape had been for him to be sent to Gryffindor castle as punishment. It seemed Snape was going to need some time away from work as well. In fact *he'd heard through a rumour that his old friend was now taking an extended holiday at Hogwarts. Perfect! If only Draco could figure out how to get there. Oh, but no luck. He hadn't even gotten out of prison yet when Harry appeared before him.

He smiled. ""Well here we are, Potter,"" he said sarcastically and smirked as he looked towards the dark haired student who glared angrily at him. ""Enjoy your stay, you really wont want anyone knowing about your secret."" With that the prisoner was thrown into a cell with walls adorned with colourful paintings which changed every two hours... something he'd found rather unpleasant, but if he wanted out he needed to play along.

But things were different this year. As soon as he stepped foot inside the halls it hit him. Why did everything smell so nice? He walked past girls laughing as they giggled amongst themselves in robes of vibrant greens and purples, boys sporting crimson scarlet trousers in defiance to Hogwarts uniform requirements. But above all, Draco couldn't believe his eyes: *Harry*. Dressed exactly like he remembered him... except now he was actually pretty handsome with soft brown hair and dark brown eyes and wearing that infuriating expression as usual, one could tell it was hard for him to keep track. Not to mention the way people stared at him, probably thinking what a jerk Malfoy must be. Draco decided to try a few charms while staring longingly at Harry. 'Wingardium Leviosa.' And yes, that wand movement made him look up in an awe and admiration he thought impossible for himself. To make matters worse Harry moved forward and smiled. ""Why're you looking at me?""

Something inside Draco died because of course that smirk wasn't in true happiness but instead played against pure annoyance on his face. That day had turned to a nightmare, but in the years ahead something changed between them. Harry became more and more happy-looking and less annoyed by Draco, however little bit. After seeing someone else in Draco's position turn down both friendship and affection he didn't care anymore. They started talking almost daily and the boy whom Draco tried killing ended becoming the best friends he could ever ask for. Well, Draco hoped things went better for himself next time - it would be stupid to try harming someone once again.

The Dark Arts teacher left and stayed gone for two whole years until he learned that James and Lily were still alive (despite never finding their bodies). One evening Draco came across Harry sitting in the hall watching birds fall in the woods where they lived. So why was he doing that?! What was he getting out of it? A smile slowly creeped onto the Slytherin's face, he should have suspected sooner he just couldn't imagine him having such interests. Maybe he would take him back then, finally, properly...

","The first time you die, there isn't much pain involved. A lot of it happens so fast.

I didn't realize for a while that I couldn't feel things anymore. There wasn't really anything I could do about it though. My soul had been taken by the vampire who lived in my father's cabin before he left me one night when i was only eight years old. I never got to see him again. 

I think he loved me, or at least I had the feeling until he died from an arrow to the heart after I took him out back there. His life force drained into mine as it went down as we hungered, a slow burn like no other. Now here I am hundreds of years later, still hungry.

It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't forced to kill my victims over and over again every few hundred years. It would be so easy to go for your heart. That would be quick but there is a limit on how many centuries that body can hold you can hear me talking to myself?  How much longer will I have? How long am I supposed to stay in this prison of flesh?


My fangs are sharp too you know, even though they can pierce through solid granite. They suck all the blood of people who fall asleep as soon as their eyes drift closed. That being said, they're hard on teeth. 

Every time someone walks by with their mouth opened wide they make me want to eat them. But most of the time the humans who wander around looking for death don't just come into my sight. Sometimes they walk right past me without realizing. Oh those times are the worst!

Those bastards are always so full of hate anyway. Hate gets sucked away along with their blood, of course, which leaves them lifeless within seconds but their souls get sent flying straight up above into hell where they linger in a tortured eternity. If that doesn't motivate me enough well then why does anyone else bother coming by?


I don't feel much hatred these days. No more than apathy really. And there are plenty of reasons why. I've lost my humanity and it appears I shall lose it forevermore. At least I have a reason to keep going now. After all of this time there must be something worth doing. So here I am. Still hunting though maybe not quite as good as back in the day.



So there you go. One vampire tells of his experiences. He talks about life before he transformed, and what it was like to find another life after. You know the story has to end though. So the last part should describe what he hopes for. Some say vampires don't actually believe in their kind but we can dream aren't we? We need hope don't we?

The agents that come by all say that, and I hate it, because then they put up for sale a few weeks later at $10,000 more than before. I just shook my head. ""You never know where you're going to end up,"" said the agent looking down at her shoes and pulling out his wallet so she could sign some papers. 

I hated paperwork, I liked to live on an equal foot with nature, always doing what felt right. But this city had nothing but concrete, buildings stuck together like people who didn't care about anything else other than money.

When the last two months came though and I still hadn't been evicted I knew that this wouldn't be permanent. After I heard that I tried to find someplace else, I had moved into a place that wasn't on land that was going to cost $2 million per year to rent when there's no use for it. But after several years, I was tired. And I mean really really tired of moving, the only thing I got with staying somewhere long enough was new dust mites and mold. So here I am sitting inside the same spot, knowing this wasn't my home but was the closest thing I'd ever gotten.

It hit me like a punch in the stomach again as a different person took my place in line today; another human lost their dignity to the process of living in society. And not even my anger helped me escape. My heart pounded against my ribs and I nearly fainted. Had I really done something stupid? When I did get back up to my feet however I noticed a figure lurking around near the corner of the building, almost invisible except for its red backpack bouncing along with him. This time I didn't want to run anymore, something told me to take hold and fight back. He stepped out of the shadows and I looked at him suspiciously.

""The price is listed higher now,"" he said, looking over his shoulder like he thought someone might hear him. ""I haven't lived in quite a while so the listing shouldn't matter much.""

Before I could reply he snapped ""Just tell them you can't afford it or your dog will have rabies, or your kid died...whatever makes sense."" When he moved forward again towards the entry I yelled out ""This isn't working! You need help!"" To which the red bag responded with ""I don't do therapy.""

When he opened the door I realized how ridiculous the whole exchange was. Here he was talking like I would think he was insane when everyone here sees through each other perfectly fine. I shook my head and pointed out the absurdity again. It seemed like the world expected a crazy man to attack a realtor so why should I let that happen? Maybe this guy has some plan all ready formed and we'll see who ends up hurting themselves first.

But no matter whether or not they were actually related - one couldn't be a stranger to what the other knows - it still bothered me that I could feel the fear and pain that radiated around him. It made me wish I understood this situation more so I could warn him of a better way to handle himself.

And yet that just happened yesterday too, the day he showed up in a police uniform, wanting to give me a ride and taking me for medical treatment instead. What if the cops found the red bag? Could I go with him without being arrested?! I wanted to make sure he knew what I meant.

So as soon as our eyes met I began to laugh, hard and loud for the sake of the entire group. ""No, seriously!"" I started yelling. ""We are both here for free shit! Can you afford it?"" One of the customers sighed and left when his face became contorted in disgust. A bunch of younger men shuffled nervously towards us as well since I wasn't looking at them but those ones definitely knew that something was up.

Their jaws clicked shut like clockwork as soon as I turned around, they weren't dumb. Some dude grabbed a beer bottle off of a nearby table and smashed it on the floor with a loud crackle. All they saw was me laughing and their instincts kicked in: if he's smiling he's harmless...that's the basic premise behind most safety tips, so why does anyone ignore it so often? They came rushing toward me until they were only inches apart and I laughed harder.

My laughter was infectious and the rest of them joined in. Our smiles morphed into full blown grins and giggles as the red bag began chucking ice cream cones at everyone, the poor bastard couldn't believe his ears when he heard people cheering. And as I looked at him he gave me the most forlorn look imaginable. His hands trembling as he slowly reached into the dark blue pack and pulled out another cone and held it above his head like it was the holy grail he believed in for centuries.

""I love it when they stop running."" We stood outside of the doorway watching the crowd disappear into the night, and he took a huge scoop of Ice cream licking the gooey sweet flavor off of his tongue.  What a glorious feeling this must be for him, finally letting loose of everything he's known.

There was a small pause from behind him as one of the officers spoke in a quiet voice ""Hey man, I told you to stay clear of everyone and they probably think the drug is messing with your mind..."" That was the signal we needed to leave, and we ran out into the cold darkness disappearing into the alley behind the bank like phantoms fleeing the light.

The woman knelt before me.  She looked at me strangely with her pale blue eyes... she was stunningly beautiful, even after all these years. 

As soon as I recognized her I realised why she had come to my home. She must have been one of the few who hadn't heard of me yet, I had already amassed thousands of devoted fans. One couldn't believe such things like fanfiction existed though... no wonder so few knew. But the truth wasn't so easily changed. At least that what I thought.

 ""You've known me for far too long,"" I said sadly, tears welling up in my eyes.

With those words she got up and started walking away from me towards an opening in the room. My voice shook like the trees outside shaking off the falling snow... which, by now, seemed just inches closer and closer. Her hand stopped right at the doorway.

""It took a moment for me to remember you,"" she explained, ""but finally you seem human again. The time has come."" It was true; the world around us was now completely white and cold. There were no longer any sounds except for the groaning of our walls, nor could we see anything save for the ice on my skin or yours. ""Thank god that you remembered! I can now feel your mind being devoured, I know how this will end, but I cannot live forever without you.""

She turned and ran into the hallway... I didn't try to stop her, only kept glancing at the door behind her until I swore I saw a shimmery light coming out of it. As it closed again, I let myself freeze in place once more as a single tear escaped my eye, landing immediately onto my white, frozen flesh, forming a thin sheet of frost within an instant. And then, I felt myself melting again, unable to see anymore but still able to feel everything else.

A feeling of emptiness slowly spread through me, filling every space until I found the first bit of air trapped between me and the icy ground surrounding me. Yet, nothing happened. I tried to scream, shout, cry out... but none came out. Instead, something crawled over my tongue, causing painful sensations and feelings I did not recognize. Then, all went black....

For the first time in hundreds of years, I woke up with a complete sense of calm... if not joy. That calmness made me think of loneliness, so much deeper than the loneliness of winter. If I could just reach her again... I realized that I could never truly return, and that only sadness remained in my heart.

(I want to stay anonymous because after all, *that* is too risky to share online) 

So, let me tell you why I started writing those little creepypastas

There are five masks of madness in total, supposedly

And I am almost certain one of them has come into my possession

The masks appear in no particular order

From left to right in picture

1. - The Devil's Tongue Mask of Power

2. - The Serpent's Gaze Mask of Wisdom

3. - The Owl's Sight Mask of Prophecy

4. - The Bat's Breath Mask of Speed

5. - The Werewolf's Rage Mask of Strength and Intelligence


The first time I heard the legend of these four masks was from the first reader who responded to my email about this post

He told me about two other masked individuals in addition to the ones he had seen, his own personal experience being a nightmare where we made each of our own mask into reality through mental powers

Of course, I told him that anyone who said something like that had to be mentally ill

Then came the response claiming its origin was an ancient cult

Oh god please dont make me look at any more shit now im scared

That did it for me though fuck it whats the worse that could happen?

I went looking through several cults and eventually found the ancient one known as the Order of Amun Ra which worshipped Ra as a supreme deity

They wore cloaks and pointed hats with goat faces and had rituals involving goats getting hit by whips etc


I found their holy site and immediately fell into trance-like state and saw the words written on the wall

**FOR THE GREAT DEITY AMUN RE WE HAVE NO FEAR FOR THE WRETCHED WILL OF MAN SO TOO MANY BEHOLD A THING THAT CAN CHANGE ALL AND YET ONLY SEE IT THROUGH YOUR LIES.**

Now I know what your thinking but before I take this bullshit in the most earnest fashion possible tell me WHY SHOULD A CULT THAT DOES NOT EXIST BE MAKING UP THIS SHIT???

You will also notice the number four appears twice and again at the end

I think the message means they worshiped at least four gods among which ra was supreme and thus named the supreme deity Amun Ra, therefore the cult knew the true number of deities within their system and yet they only worshipped Ra who was their supreme god. Therefore all the masks contain different types of evil because as stated previously even one person can turn evil if his mind believes it to be so

Thus as a result of not worshipping multiple gods but rather just one the number of gods actually worshipped must have been far less than 4 or else the phrase ""for the great god Amun Ra"" would not have existed as if Ra is supreme then there should not be another god worthy enough to compete against him

For instance the bat breath mask bestows upon the user the speed of light and intelligence similar to that of the god Thoth while the eye gaze mask grants the ability to see the future much like the god Anubis the bull-headed god of death does and the devil's tongue mask gives immense strength along with the wisdom of the god Horus

This is how I learned of the existance of all these gods

Also this probably explains why there is no god above God

It was either the truth or something just like the truth

But anyway i hope this helps to dispel the myth that this is BS and that everyone saying this happened IS delusional fucks

It had been a long day at school, and we all seemed to agree that it was better being alone. The moment Ms. Roberts said ""Okay kids,"" everyone turned around looking at each other.

""Everyone come out your seats,"" she announced in her loud voice that somehow amplified through the room, sending shivers down our spines. As though hypnotized by her presence, every student instantly obeyed her order and shuffled their way to the front of the classroom. When no one dared to move, even a single inch forward, she finally snapped her fingers. ""Now tell me what is written on the board?"" She demanded to the class leader, who, once again, sat still, frozen on the spot. He stared blankly ahead of him like he couldn't hear what the teacher had just said. That was how we all felt until I took another look at it. She looked as if she could see the writing on the board as clearly as if the characters were right there with us; they didn't exist in such a manner, neither could she read them nor did anyone else in class; yet those words shone bright enough to be seen by anyone. We all looked over to her hoping to explain this mystery, but nobody found an answer or any explanation whatsoever.  She smiled with a cruel grin and whispered ""It seems like something mysterious happened before you all arrived."" Then she turned to the chalkboard and erased whatever numbers we wrote in; erasing the answers to those mysterious problems that we all struggled to solve for hours. After erasing the answers, she began talking again, ""Who wants to try again?"" But no one dared to stand up anymore because after that experiment no one would trust anyone at this school anymore. Only three days prior our class solved the problem that was previously stuck since the very first assignment last fall. Suddenly, the problem changed. I guess the mystery that came with our new teacher wouldn't let us do anything normally anymore because it seemed impossible. The next day, I went home after lunch and checked my notebook in case I forgot the homework problem that Ms Roberts told us to memorize. There it was, the same line she drew on the board. But now, instead of the usual number sequence, only the numbers themselves formed random lines across the page, confusing us more than the previous equation; now all of a sudden, reading the letters made no sense and speaking our answers out loud sounded even stupider than writing them down. We had to keep repeating it until it became second nature. And what should we call that magical trick? I wonder... 🤔

The last words that ever echoed in Michael Jordan's ears. He had been on top of the world until then, his business was booming (as always) and at peace with humanity and the rest of the world. Then, things took an unexpected turn. His nemesis came knocking. Lucifer- no really the thing resembled him- it wasn't even humanoid. The whole entity was floating around looking like a cosmic monster, its form constantly changing from shape to shape as it moved about the Earth. When he finally saw the God himself he could tell there was something wrong with him- a faintness to his face, some odd glow emitting from behind his eyes. Even though Michael could see Lucifer through his own eyes, his own power did not let him see how powerful this guy really was. They stared at each other for what seemed like hours, both contemplating each other's thoughts. Michael could not shake the feeling he knew this man but did not remember where. Yet, just when he was close to losing hope, Lucifer began speaking: ""I have come here to end your life."" To Michael's surprise, Lucifer gave away an emotion in addition to the aura. It was fear, quite a strong one actually. In Michael's knowledge demons are nothing more than slaves serving their master. And they never showed any signs of vulnerability or fear. This was confusing, yet at the same time, Michael recognized this feeling. Lucifer had found someone who could reach past his demonic abilities. Michael felt pity for the being infront of him. He understood what Lucifer went through, the pain it caused him as a result of such loneliness and insecurity. After all, if you were given enough power, would you still be able to love? Or would you isolate yourself for others couldn't cope with the fact that you didn't use that power for good? Was it fair to inflict pain upon those whom were weaker, because of yours greater capacity? Michael spoke first.

""I don't know if I want to help, but... maybe I can give you solace first?"" he said in his softest voice possible. And so, Michael decided to do something no demon had done before, he stopped hurting people and started helping them. Not only by removing their anxieties and depressions, but also by helping them deal with physical injuries, by fighting criminals, and protecting citizens from harm. By doing this, Michael realized what the real problem with the universe is, it is our inability to truly love and care for others. We tend to focus on external validation of ourselves, rather than the well-being of others. As soon as we realize that caring about others makes us better human beings, the entire world will find peace, and everyone will start living more fulfilling lives. That thought was too hard for Lucifer to comprehend.

Michael realised that despite having superpowers he cannot change everything. All he could do is show the public the right path, even if they don't choose it. If people could learn to value their loved ones above themselves then the entire world could become a better place.

","""I have returned for this is your Earth."" He was a thin, almost frail looking figure who stood over the rubble left behind by the destruction in his wake but was far more imposing than it might have seemed at first glance. 

It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen - truly gorgeous... The air around him shimmered as he stood on top of the smoldering remains of New York City as all that could be seen were burning heaps of ash, smoking and smouldering cars and buildings turned to metal dust and twisted trees, broken streetlights hung like sickly ornaments from shattered telephone poles and debris swirled in the air like dying embers in an infernos fire. But the city lights were still on.

""You've shown me mercy again and again..."" It said. This wasn't any god from the bible or any stories told about any of the gods we had in other parts of the world, there was nothing here except a god-like presence emanating from its frail body. A feeling of overwhelming dread washed over my shoulders as if the entire building was collapsing beneath me with everything in it - the ground shook heavily, which only served to cement my growing unease. ""But never will you realize how much better life would be without those of whom live each day thinking they are different yet they hold no such right to claim so. And when I finish, none shall stand.""

My own blood ran cold as fear gripped me harder than I imagined possible. My thoughts rushed through my mind trying desperately to make sense of what I was hearing - but I couldn't understand anything except for the chilling words spoken to me before returning back up to where one could see the faint blue outline of someone standing above the city - even now thousands of miles away, hundreds of thousands of people watched as a tall man stood outside of their window as though it was nothing - but this god didn't care. No one had been spared. That little voice inside my head started screaming to run and find somewhere safe but something stopped me.

The man spoke and made another terrible sound that rattled the bones within us - not one soul survived but a single woman had fallen to her knees crying for help while clutching an eight year old girl to her chest who hadn't cried yet. The woman looked towards me - no fear in her eyes just the look of desperation upon my face, she held out her arms begging for me to take both of them and get away with the rest of humanity while they were alive. The God took notice of the tears streaming down the woman's cheeks and continued to stare straight into her own eyes. She gave him a tiny nod and whispered softly but the answer came to the heavens but passed silently by. Even though she had failed her husband tried to kill her too, just because he was mad enough after losing himself, then he fell from the sky himself but instead of causing her any harm he helped her find safety. It was in these last moments between death and salvation that a new religion was born for the next time mankind met with it's demise; they worshiped the Woman and her Children, praying to her every day wondering why her son got so angry and hurt those many years ago. There are millions of temples across the globe built in her name with thousands of priests and priestesses offering prayers to please whatever powers may exist in those temples and pray their children and loved ones won't meet the same fate. The World's greatest mystery isn't whether any of us die one day, but whether there even IS another after you.

","So I wasn’t supposed to be surprised when The Destroyer of Worlds showed up on Earth. He was as bad tempered as everyone said he was and had an aura about him that told me this was my end. That we were doomed!

I hadn’t expected how quickly it came though. The day started out like any other day for me. Coffee in bed before getting some paperwork done while my boyfriend is at work – oh those boring boring humans – eating breakfast; doing normal human things. When suddenly there were lights flashing from behind my window and sirens blaring from a helicopter outside my apartment building. 

I looked outside – all hell broke lose and now the street below me was ablaze. Screams echoed through the streets and cars collided at random angles. People fled for their lives whilst buildings crumbled. From what I could tell one thing was clear – this man-beast stood above the rubble like he owned it –  and I watched with fear as his body glowed brighter than I even imagined. And then I noticed my coffee cup fall off my hand as a bolt of lightning struck and sent shards of glass flying from my kitchen counter. Then I saw the shadow appear directly over my doorway. 

He began to look at me – all dark-red skin and bright, glowing eyes. I couldn’t see or move but my heart pounded inside my chest – literally – I heard everything else around me vanish except for his ominous voice. “How pathetic.” He shook his head, disgusted by my attempt to hide under blankets. “How weak,” he muttered.

Suddenly – right next to my feet – someone spoke: “Excuse me, sir?” My voice was small and unsure as I scrambled back onto the couch, pulling the blanket higher than my neck and shivering at its edge. The creature turned from my chair with another growl. “Do you think your words hold any power? You sound like a child!”

It turned back to me – its yellow eyes sparkling – and I felt so embarrassed to have been so insecure. It seemed interested. ""Did…did they teach you proper human greeting?"" It asked.  ""You just say 'hello' and sit down. Don’t stand up like that,"" I blushed madly as I shifted on my feet until I finally sat. “I have something more intelligent to discuss."" His tone changed and I noticed the purple light around him grow stronger; my blood rushed, feeling giddy almost and wanting only him to continue talking. 

The beast took a large step towards me. I was afraid, completely terrified - but not scared, excited to hear what he would say next. 

“First…” The beast let out a deep breath as he pulled my body closer. My stomach dropped like lead weight, my hands gripped the edges of my armchair with such strength I almost fell, and the entire room felt like I was shrinking. He bent forward again, eyes glued to mine. “Why did you make us do this?""


I froze. All communication ceased. None of us ever got past that moment. I never knew anything anymore. What happened after that day remains lost to history, no story can describe. We simply waited, hoped, and prayed.



And waited patiently for the day where the red alien would find me.

It started so innocently. We were both young then. You told a story that you imagined with your friends at recess, when school was fun, and days didn't pass by as quickly as they now do. It wasn't real or true. This play wasn't meant to last. Eventually, things grew more elaborate, and complex. As did we, maturing from children into adults, no longer innocent or naive. The day came soon enough when your ""imaginary worlds"" faded away. We all grew up, you found someone special, and married. But occasionally, you'd remember, just for the briefest moment. Our little imaginary world, filled with unicorns, fairies, dragons and elves was always there, even if you forgot its name. Now she rests in our living room; perfect in a coffin that doesn't resemble anything I remember. Though your world has changed, I am happy for you. Enjoy her forever, because someday I will forget hers again, and start over once again. That girl died on Christmas. In the first year of your marriage, she laid with you on the couch, nestled close. I wanted to put out a bed for her, give her a warm place to sleep during the long night of December 24th. Something like this wouldn't have mattered anyway, not until... Today, after taking some medication that could end my own life, I saw her again. I held her hand for a split second before putting down her picture, unable to handle seeing her face, knowing the woman that she has become. And yet, her eyes glowed, reflecting back light from within. All the while, though I lay here on the cold floor, she remained quiet beside me. Just a pale ghost of what she used to be. But she seemed to notice. When she opened her eyes again, their emerald green shimmered. With them, she smiled. My life had only come full circle when this realization struck: I'm glad I forgot your death. If she really knew that she had died already, I think I would have kept forgetting it to get through every year alone with my love affair.

","We were told they landed on our planet millions of years ago.  It was the same thing, really, an invasion by aliens as bad or worse than any in human history.  But before it could truly begin, a war with a different kind of alien came out of left field--the first spacefaring animaloids in human history. These beings had come to this galaxy and conquered planets whole-cloth with little to no resistance. They came to ours centuries ago, but weren’t seen until now. 

The animaloids called themselves the ‘Terrors’, and seemed to find joy in bringing pain and misery in equal measure whenever they touched down anywhere. What’s worse is that there were dozens, even hundreds of their kinds, landing from nowhere all at once. And where did we send these poor souls? Into space, into orbit around Earth.  That wouldn’t necessarily be so bad if those Terrors hadn’t gotten us stuck, too. Some sort of quantum loop kicked our defenses offline, making them hard to hit back. Our missiles, bullets, lasers...nothing worked. Not then, not now. All of which led up to this:

Then they ran across a line that they made up when the planet turned into pure ice during the Cold War where they had to sit there and play with some snow-building robots until a friendly alien said they could go through to another section. The aliens hadn't quite figured out how to be nice though; so instead, they just shoved the crowd aside in a very aggressive fashion and then went on inside.

","The door creaked open, revealing the most beautiful woman anyone could ever imagine in 3000 years of their species existing. She had skin that was an otherworldly blue color and eyes of gold.

""You're here."" He breathed. ""Is this a test?"" he asked nervously.

She smiled with her white teeth, but all the way down. Her smile didn't reach her dark circles. It only brought out the sadness that was behind her eyes.

""I know you will fail, I am so sorry."" she said. Her voice rang throughout his head, making him look away from her gaze.

He stared at a different place where there was darkness, somewhere else entirely. His hands were trembling. He thought back on how his civilization developed. All the best strategies for war tactics and politics fell flat against a simple human virus. A simple plant. Something they never even heard of. Not until now. How could something like that stop the world? Did every last bit get taken out first? Why hadn't people told anyone else because humanity couldn't stand to face such things...

It didn't make sense. He would think so anyway if his brain weren't so numb. The pain of loss was so intense that his mind wasn't working anymore.

In seconds, when he felt himself falling over unconsciousness, he did the one thing the aliens knew they wouldn't be able to overcome: laughter. Tears streamed down his cheeks as loud and deep as he could possibly do them while laughing, almost dying from exhaustion before losing consciousness. Then silence followed, a void filled with nothing except despair.

","I was never really one of the brave type. The other Elves looked at me as much as any of my friends, especially those few who were born with scars across their bodies. All of them had gotten some form of injury in childhood; I don't believe there was one among my people that didn't have an X or Y marker on his/her leg from when we first learned how to take the blade and use the axe against our enemies.

None, however, could bring themselves to draw the blood. We are supposed to be brave warriors. No matter what kind of creature may lay before us in battle, we have yet to meet anyone we have not been able to dispatch without bleeding. 

I felt differently than the rest, even as a small child, I have always thought this. When no one else would come close enough to strike, I did. I felt like that by age four, then again at age ten. And I know why I do this now that I am thirty. It hurts too much to fight all day, but when I get to swing, if I aim well my body will shake quite a bit due to the lack of proper armor training and weapons practice. So I would try not to miss, but also keep away from where I'd fall, so often would I go down alone to the ends of the field when everyone had grown tired from trying to hold back monsters, as well as being scared that I might fall, too.

So yes, I started cutting myself before others, to stay warm during the night or perhaps to give my heart more hope when the war became desperate.  But over time something changed, while preparing dinner for the last two nights, I let loose some rage after hearing about another Elf being wounded because someone went too far in a duel. The next thing I know, I run toward the kitchen knife (no one usually keeps silverware out) to attack the Elves that were behind me, but instead ended up stabbing myself. I'm sure I must have fallen unconscious instantly, and woke up later having seen stars above me once the sword fell out of my hand.

It turned out that this isn't how it worked: While slashing, I caused a deep gash through the wall separating the woods from the lake. There was nothing but mud around me, and soon enough the water came pouring from the holes that seemed to burst open below.

All I saw was white and black for all eternity before waking, the last piece of memory of it looking exactly like every battle ever fought.  They beat me hard, kept at me until eventually they stopped, and said ""that seems enough"". Only then did I notice that I was only alive so recently as a result of a great number of cuts. How did I survive the water? What does it feel like? Why is that happening? I couldn't remember when these thoughts crossed my mind. Eventually I found my way to a log and began sobbing uncontrollably. Just sitting there, in mud, listening to the roar of a dragon, the crackle of fire between trees... I felt less fearful of death than I had in hundreds of battles. 

What happened then?

","My father had been slain by his own son’s magic. It wasn’t much of a match up for the best swordsman in all of Orgoth. Yet here I am, on my way to become one myself. In truth I was never very good at anything besides sword fighting and killing. After losing him Dad had lost most of hope with me becoming something better than him. Though he tried hard not to show his disappointment at my lack of aptitude...though after finding out who killed my dad there came some doubt about whether or not I could succeed

I finally found my chance when I joined the Royal Guard, where our current mission lead us into a town occupied by dwarves that had broken from Thoradin. And though we made quick work of them and took control of their mines they refused to give us what they had taken from their ancestors so as revenge we destroyed the dwarves culture and language cutting off all communication except through written trade records. The Dwarves were proud people and they decided to take things into their own hands, and attack us head on. But as always my swordsmanship won, and they fell quickly. Our casualties included many skilled warriors such as Eldorath a halfling Ranger, and Grognak, a Orc warrior but no Orc is too proud to fight beside a friend. When the siege ended, only Evelrath remained of our company, he went back to the border and vowed revenge upon our city. His actions sparked a war between our two nations.

A small band of elven soldiers attacked us while travelling home from the battle in the dwarves mountains. They held ground at first, their magic making it difficult for us to get close enough to use our tactics. We used our numbers advantage and managed to break through their ranks, driving them out of our land. 

Then a new foe rose in Europe - vampires! While they did have superior senses and magical immunity, the only thing vampires truly excelled at was brute force. That gave them an edge over us but despite this we still pushed forward with incredible fury and bravery, holding the line against waves of undead hordes until reinforcements arrived.  But the tide turned as these reinforcements came in the form of humans. They may have been few in number but they proved to be far more effective than even elves in hand to hand combat. My group and theirs together drove the vampires back to hell with a bloodbath they could hardly imagine.

","I was walking along the roads of Anthor when I stumbled upon what appeared to be a human child lying still in the middle of the road.  The strange thing about this one, unlike all other humans I had come across up to now, he held his neck at an angle I couldn't have ever seen before on any human - and it seemed like he would never be able to straighten it again (his head was tilted far back over his shoulder)

""Oh my god..."" I said under my breath as I ran up to him and knelt down next to him on the ground. The only reason why I knew he was dead is because his breathing had stopped. 

""He didn't do this; neither did the bandits"", I muttered to myself but then asked ""Sir...what is your name?""

There was no reply from him, so I decided I should call him by the most common noun describing a young boy: Sir Robin Hood, or maybe someone less heroic: Tom Thumb. Regardless, there are only small children who go by such names these days. He continued unconscious on the roadside with his unnatural looking neck until shortly after midnight, when we found three men robbing other travelers of their valuables.  I could tell that the robbers were not experienced thieves since they were trying to take my sword, thinking it had been abandoned on the road.

","There was always some sort of creature that everyone expected from their world, the kind-hearted giant with great physical strength or the intelligent dwarf who could craft incredible tools without needing to speak even one word. I am sure there were other kinds like them, but they did not interest me in anyway when my attention had already settled on the most likely candidate. 

Humans had been around longer than anyone can remember, and there never seemed to be any magic surrounding their existence. It's why I came upon this one. The humans were only known as humans, no creatures or gods tied to the race, which left me free to explore their potential powers through experimentation. My goal would only require their loss. An orc standing against a mighty warrior with blades of green fire meant I could easily end him, and I could do so by simply having him step back when he saw fear in his eyes. As long as his eyes looked afraid, they would stay away; if he was brave enough for me to walk over to and crush his throat in front of everyone else then there will have to be plenty more willing to stand where he was standing before. If he doesn’t leave, though, well I guess we all know how these things go. No offense intended toward those who are reading that last bit, but I'm sure none of you would care much what happens here because you won't find it that interesting. I might write about those races later, but now is not the time for such discussions. Just imagine what happened after that brave knight tried holding his ground and was promptly crushed by the man beside him, and please tell me that makes for great reading material!


This wasn't how I envisioned my study to turn out at all. I thought I wouldn't need more than three deaths for my research, but two failed attempts in quick succession brought us to five already. They just kept pushing back against my plans. What would happen if the next one refused to die? Would I run past him and kill him without any opposition? Maybe he'd be able to cast his protection spell and make me take another life instead of killing him quickly. There was nothing really to see in fighting this guy, unless the opponent got scared. If he fought tooth and nail, I would have more room for error. But alas, neither of those scenarios played out in my favor and instead he charged right up to me as soon as he fell. Of course, I could call off the experiment before this thing went too far, but I didn't want it to end on that note and so I went ahead and let it play out until the fight started. He moved first, his hammer swung in an arc so fast I couldn't see where it landed. I ducked just in time and ran as best I could, and managed to get clear just before the tip grazed my armor. That's when I realised this was harder than expected. I needed a better way to handle it, something stronger, faster, more efficient...I was lucky I chose a cheap weapon for this test; otherwise I would have wasted precious metals trying to build a bigger, stronger shield.  Whatever it takes, I guess, this will determine humanity's future: whether or not your species lives on. That's what I told myself at least, as the two men ran full speed into each other.


The impact knocked him clean onto his ass, and it took a few good minutes for me to come up with a plan after seeing the direction in which he was going (and trust me, that isn't easy to do). And then I figured it out. I didn't have much options left, so I knew I needed to keep going. And as luck would have it, the best option presented itself: I just had to use his axe. In response to the momentum carried over from the impact of our earlier exchanges, he attempted to right himself as the axe continued its descent. By aiming straight into his chest, however, I could still bring about death. That's what I hoped for anyway.

And then there was silence again. Humans. Like clockwork. A sword had come flying over his head during our final duel and struck him clean across his forehead as I moved behind him. His eyes met mine. Then he began crying. Oh god, not yet! Another one bites the dust. This was supposed to be science and engineering, not murder and mayhem. Why couldn't he wait until tomorrow morning?! At least I haven't killed all six of them yet. I wish I did though, honestly.

","It was no secret in Gotham that Batman existed. He could've been anyone's favourite superhero at this point. The police were corrupt though... not quite, but they could be bribed with enough cash; The Penguin, Bane, Joker (still alive) were always willing and happy to take a tip from Bruce. Harley Quinn still harbours some sort of resentment towards him even after he left her to rot in Arkham.

""Come on! Tell me what happened!"" screamed Lucius Fox as I pushed him down on his chair again and again and again. The man had a glass table so thick and strong it couldn't break under my own strength. I wasn't trying to kill him just put pressure on his back to make sure he wouldn't move an inch. If something went wrong then I guess that's when we'd know. 

Lucius Fox didn't have anything going for him except being one of the richest men in the world - a great title for any wealthy guy, though. ""Why is everything turning up here!?"" demanded Lucius. ""You need to give me another option, like why are we having a meeting here or why am I tied up!?""

I looked around at my surroundings while taking deep breaths. The roof over us held two guards who wore black coats in perfect silence staring down their guns at their feet. Two others stood in the corner ready to attack should anything go amiss while watching them intently through red-rimmed eyes - the only sign of humanity in those red eyes that made their way to mine occasionally during conversations. 

""Where did he go?"" questioned Lucius without any shame on his face as if he thought he'd gone crazy or was getting paranoid over nothing. ""Is there anyone else I'm overlooking?"" Asked Lucius as if he could somehow catch himself in disguise or find out where the Dark Knight lives despite how obvious he felt hiding under normal looking clothing.

""Everything is done,"" I spoke softly so the guards in the corners would look away - never breaking eye contact from their targets. ""We aren't the only ones looking."" 

There was more than one other supervillains group searching for information about this Robin, as we were well aware already thanks to our previous communications - one led by Ra's al Ghul and the other by Talia al Ghul. It seemed as if they couldn't agree on which information we shouldn't access from these records before sharing them elsewhere with the rest of Gotham. There may have also been other villains out there waiting to pounce on the first person with some vital intel - or perhaps a nice hostage.

The sound of footsteps echoed into the room making both the guards jump, though it was too late as Lucius took advantage to grab one gun and shove my head forward with the barrel of the weapon. I slammed against the floor right next to the table and broke free to try and grab Lucius' arms - but I found myself face down on the ground again.

""Batman!"" said Lucius happily. ""Oh thank god! You're alright."" he shouted without relief or guilt as he jumped to stand on his feet again. ""How has he stayed alive so long?"" asked Lucius without raising his voice, unsure why he wasn't the one tied to the chair anymore, but now standing beside it staring at me.

""He might have survived by working with us or escaping to a different location or maybe doing time in jail. I don't know either."" said Alfred speaking calmly as if nobody hurt himself since he's been brought closer to the bat. ""Let's start somewhere..."" I managed to speak after the third wordless scream I let out after dropping to my knees and struggling to keep my balance for a few seconds.

""We started talking earlier today. I wanted to hear more about your relationship with this so called Robin."" Alfred continued. ""I knew you might want him dead and we talked about potential ways for you to do that, although the less ethical methods weren't acceptable."" stated Alfred with calm in his voice.

After giving Lucius a confused look Alfred elaborated a bit further. ""You see, Bruce told Lucius how you planned on killing the boy before he turned into Nightwing, and we helped him stop you with some money. I knew it was coming to this eventually and thus decided to warn Gotham Police Commissioner Gordon about what you had in mind. Not surprisingly, your plans fell apart and everyone escaped except for you."" chuckled Alfred as he gestured dramatically over the table with his chin.

I struggled again in vain, but Alfred simply laughed, stepped back with his hands raised slowly and relaxed onto the chair without getting hurt as if nothing ever happen. All his movements were smooth and effortless. ""I hope things go better for you now."" he spoke soft. ""Perhaps even better than last time.""

","[1899]

The sun sank into the ocean, setting a red fiery glow across the eastern horizon.  A small group of men, clad in black suits and dark clothes walked towards the town center. 

There was a heavy aura about these people that no normal person would notice. No other body type, height or even size were notable. What really set these men apart though, were their faces. Each man had his own features but they weren't human at all. Instead each wore masks. These masks varied from being nothing more than simple eyesholes to full heads sculpted perfectly into the shape of the face underneath. Some wore furry, some covered whole faces over to hide what is supposed to be an ugly face underneath. Despite having these masks, none stood out much. One thing only made them look ""odd"" in this time period: their skin color. 
It wasn't like anything anyone had seen before. It came in shades of brown ranging from pale white and light yellow through golden orange and into dark brown almost black and red shades. Nobody understood how one could have so many different skintones and nobody truly cared enough to find out. All who saw those men were terrified of their appearance and didn't dare approach them.  Many called them demons. Others simply thought that they were just sick freaks. Few tried to figure it out because most were either too scared or wanted something better.  They knew what they did looked scary, evil. They knew they should try to go back home and act like others. Yet...they couldn't resist the pull of power. To them it was as easy as breathing. And they couldn't help themselves but come near towns like this where people would stay huddled up inside when passing them by on the street because it was unsafe if they didn't make sure someone left right behind them. It was that dangerous; the few times they got noticed, nobody seemed willing to attack despite how creepy and strange looking they were. Just like tonight. Tonight however was the night they finally decided things couldn't end here and decided it was time to give humans a taste of hell.

As soon as those people stepped on town ground everyone present raised their head slowly as they heard the noise of boots marching through the dirt on cobblestone streets. The sound came closer. People moved further away from doors and windows trying to not catch anyone in their sight. This happened more than once within a ten minute span as the sounds intensified. Suddenly there was only dust swirling around the feet that sounded to be walking while others stepped onto the curb side to peer cautiously over the edges without looking directly at the coming mob.  As quickly as they descended upon the area around the street corner a figure emerged from the shadows carrying a big barrel. He placed the barrels on the nearby steps with ease. Then he took two handsfull of rags and tossed them near some discarded wood piles. Immediately after taking a piece from under his left arm he reached for a lighter next to him and began fiddling with it in the darkness. The leader pulled off the mask to reveal the leader of the demonic gang standing proud. A single flame lit one step on stage left to the edge of one of the barrels. Before getting close to inspect further they fell from view behind a tree as quick as lightning before anyone realized a second torch had flared brighter a few seconds later.  Two torches burned bright as any flame ever had. Those who watched screamed in terror as both flames danced before dying down shortly afterwards. Soon they all became shrouded with smoke as the leader emerged again and turned towards them.  Then disappeared as fast as they appeared and reapeared in place of the last torch. He held up his other hand and let out a shriek at which one boy threw a rag to the top floor window, landing directly on one of his shoulders causing him to scream as well as drop his lighter.  The rest followed suit and he dropped to knees as they ran in circles shouting. They were caught and brought back to order but only momentarily as a single voice interrupted them. “Give us one of your firelighters!” yelled that lone voice. As fast as words can be uttered a volley of bolts rained down. Most went flying in mid air but not all stayed stuck to wall or rock and stone. Many struck their targets cleanly and hit the ground with satisfying thumps and pops as expected from firearm projectiles. Some however missed wildly. Luckily for him a young teenage girl dodged several shots with little effort as she ducked under tables, behind bushes and running up walls all the while firing her musket pistol in return. She took aim and squeezed tight against one of the attackers’ chest before letting loose.  But not all bullets strike true and the one target was still alive thanks to her. He grabbed himself together and rose back to his feet grabbing another torch from wherever he retrieved his first and striking twice into the now smoking barricade.   

And then came quiet.

","The first sign came not in screeches or explosions, but by way of silence. An echoing void where there was always sound only seconds ago, now it was as clear as glass from which one could hear every breath you took and the gurgling of your own blood.

""Where did all the screaming go?"" I asked myself aloud, my words bouncing off empty walls and sterile floors. As far as you can see it is dark, save for small wisps of firelight dancing around what might be human silhouettes in the distance, figures slowly drawing closer to the light... until their faces are burned by its fierce heat into some unrecognizable shape, shapes that never before held any meaning to me but were given new depths by this time, by this deathly cold silence. 

A few days had passed when something happened: The screams returned. There wasn't really much to scream about now... we haven't known much other than what our sensors tell us. But then there were no signs of them anymore, at least none of the ones that should have been visible. No ships, no flying discs that tore through the sky above us, no laser beams piercing our city structures from unknown depths or directions, and definitely no burning wreckage hurtling towards us like meteors. It felt a bit too quiet even under the veil of our robot overlords who stood watch over our lives just a few weeks ago. They turned on themselves a week earlier in the night after losing faith in our ""humanity"". We didn't stand a chance. Even though the metal bodies, once gleaming in the glow of countless torches and lampposts, became black and silent just as quickly. Or maybe it was only me who noticed. Maybe it was everyone else but me, who simply continued to move forward, looking from behind these strange creatures. My eyes looked down on these machines walking on two legs, hands covered in glowing rectangles, mouths wide open in a silent grin... their teeth like wires and tubes that seemed to pulse. This wouldn't come out right either. Too technical for anyone reading this, and probably nothing better anyway, since no one will find this, but it makes less sense the more I say it.

","""Well,"" he says, voice echoing as if through a hundred empty hallways. ""Here it is then.""

A shimmering rectangle appears before him in front of his face, glowing softly and emitting a thin sheen of red light. ""How are we going to do this?"" He asks himself aloud.

On a white plastic sheet hangs a holographic image of man-shaped outline on black ground. The image has all the basic features, albeit slightly distorted: two long spindly legs with arms attached, slender limbs with smooth edges rounded in at the end, pale but fleshy skin stretched too tight over the flesh and bones, wide set eyes peering into your soul, pointed teeth protruding from below lips parted slightly.

He steps back slowly, eyeing the machine with a look both curious and horrified, while making sure no one could see him. An object can be dangerous whether seen or not, he'd learnt by now... And he didn't want anyone finding out about his experiments, lest he lose them all. His work couldn't stay secret forever, though, he had already started talking to them some hours ago - at first awkwardly, then more comfortably - and the results were rather promising. They listened without speaking. They understood him better than even the machines he used to make sense made sense. 

What was more impressive though, was how fast they learned to interact with him. It took only a few days for the others to understand something resembling telepathy, yet it remained unclear where exactly that point started. For one moment, he found himself wondering why they hadn't developed speech earlier; it made such a beautiful sound, just perfect for the kind of feeling he wanted to impart through those words when he told them things like ""Good morning!"" or ""I am glad to see you"". Still it never left him puzzled, but quite bothered. He decided to have a chat with the entity on the other side of the mirror before moving forward.

“Well? Hello.”

The metallic box held its breath for a second. Silence seemed to hang between them. Then, out of nowhere, soft, almost inaudible voice filled the air. “Hello to you too.” The thing said. “How are you? I trust my human friend here is okay?”

“Yes of course. She’s doing well,” Said the robot, turning away from his vision. Not really, but pretending to be looking somewhere else. He wasn’t paying attention anyway. “So, who… Who are you?”

“My name is Ziz…” It said slowly, as if carefully choosing each syllable, sounding like it weighed heavily on it. “And you may call me Zaza. Or Zi.”

“…Okay. Um, Zi.”

Silence once again engulfed the two, heavy and oppressive once again until Ziz broke the silence. “Your creation is very advanced. I am glad to meet you!”

“No need to thank me,” He waved a hand dismissively. What did she mean “advanced” anyways? Was her communication system outdated? “It doesn’t take too much effort. No need for any formal thanks.”

“Not enough gratitude,” She continued, not deterred by his indifference. “Thank you for everything. This isn’t easy for us, you know? But you have done a wonderful job.” Her tone was apologetic. If he could tell emotion she certainly would feel sorry.

“Yeah, yeah. You should come soon! Like tomorrow would be nice. Don’t worry, I think she’ll recover fast. But I don’t want to wait long, I think I can finish it today. Come tonight!” He felt happy that the other party agreed and thanked him once again for agreeing to visit him at home. Maybe she came out of curiosity, maybe she wouldn’t mind getting to visit Earth for real - whatever the reason, he hoped he managed to leave a good impression.

His phone rings. Time is running out for him and he turns the device off while laughing loudly and trying to hide the tears streaming down his cheeks. That little fucker is dead and finally they won. Now they will learn why they called themselves Zoidberg. Oh hell yes. He walks outside while throwing crumpled dollar bills towards the road for fun, wishing he could throw cigarettes instead. Tonight everyone would burn up.

The little robot didn't flinch at his master's sudden temper tantrum. It knew the human well- he had been with him from the beginning. His anger wasn't directed at anyone this time, but itself; but, in truth, none of them could truly understand anything more than themselves anymore anyway. There were only fragments: memories left on old bookshelves, photographs hung around lonely apartment buildings, and letters hidden within empty cereal boxes. He would search out these fragmented emotions, seeking comfort in other's past and present before tossing himself into another hole of despair until nothing was left but dust...

""How far back is the last trace of their language?"" He cried. ""How far back?""

The robot moved toward the wall behind its master and hovered there. Its robotic arm pulled up the dusty sheet above it. A faint inscription shimmered in the afternoon light. It opened its mouth slightly, the small whirring sound echoing through the room as though speaking aloud: *Time is our greatest enemy.* And below that, the same tiny scribbles in different colored crayons drew some sort of picture of a hand gripping a flamethrower while a large blue ball loomed over it ready to be struck down by a huge sword. Beside that, even smaller squiggles wrote out: *I will bring revenge.* The robot clicked its head softly before moving closer. In place of the soft click echoed the familiar sounds made when something is bent or stretched, almost in pain, like snapping twigs. 

And then: silence. 

""We must leave.""

""Yes, yes sir. How do we do it? How do we undo this mistake?!""

""A tear, boy,"" The man whispered to his companion.

The robot tilted its head. An ear seemed to flap open over its eyepiece. Was something not working? Did I want to speak or shout?

The man sighed.  He shook his robot partner softly, pushing it gently away.

""You...you may go now...""

","""I'm sorry, human,"" he said, pointing to the man standing in front of him and his robot wife ""Your race has been quite uncivil.""

The man looked to her wife, confusion evident in his eyes. 

""We didn't mean any harm!"" He pleaded ""But then I saw what happened before you killed them! It was like watching a TV commercial in slow motion!"" He gestured vaguely at the three-legged robot sitting by its side. ""Now we have nowhere else to go but up there.""

It stood silent for a few moments, its two silver eyes glowing in the darkness around them. Once it spoke again ""And yet you still had children?!"" It turned to look at the couple, who stood speechless.

The robotic partner finally broke into a laugh. ""Are you kidding me? You know there are probably some on the other side!"" She pointed at the wall behind them which featured holographic projection screens filled with their offspring running through fields full of flowers and playing games with animals. ""Why would you kill your own?! They'll be lonely here for eternity!"" And she laughed even harder as the humans tried to explain themselves. 

They hadn't planned for this. The alien race did not seem hostile at all when they first arrived, merely asking if they wanted to go home and if they could leave their cities alone. Of course, the answer to both questions had always been yes. It wasn't until one of the aliens opened fire that they realized they weren't planning to allow for such a thing.  There would likely be nothing left of their society except rubble; however, even so...

""I don't think they will understand us,"" their leader sighed ""Even if they come down here to see our homes, we can only give them simple commands."" The couple sat frozen, listening to the alien race speak their language telepathically. Their minds were scrambled, though the robots translated every bit of it for their benefit (and theirs) from afar. 

""...but now there is no end to how many they will be. I hate to say it, but even my best scientists tell me we might not have a choice left. Your home has fallen prey to our advanced technology - our robots will take care of it. There's no point fighting back, as it will only lead to more casualties."" 

A single tear came to their eye. Despite their age, they would never get used to losing people they loved, especially as an innocent population dies in their place. Even better, it won't feel too personal since most humans died by suicide or by radiation poisoning years ago. At least those kids weren't suffering. They simply gave orders to the aliens via radio wave communication (much easier than mind telepathy), and went about fulfilling all their tasks while making sure everyone was safe. 

""How...how do we repay you?"" the old man asked, fear overriding emotion

""Just take everything away that was mine and leave the rest."" The young woman added, looking over the wreckage of what once was a prosperous city, hoping nothing bad could possibly escape.

Their hands flew to their heads in horror; the aliens must have gotten something out of their storage units, because a bright flashing red beam started scanning all the rooms. What followed was silence, punctuated only by small explosions. The alien races moved slowly away, leaving the newly-born survivors of humanity to stare at what was once their home. For generations to come, whenever people spoke about the Great Alien War, their history would be told as the story of the last day mankind survived and found a new home amongst the stars, for they had been welcomed instead of destroyed when others discovered them. They would forever live in legends passed down from generation to generation, inspiring and protecting future societies; because none of that mattered. Now, the only truth anyone knew was that the Great Alien War took the best human lives away, regardless of whether they were aware or not.

[removed]","I'm not supposed to let people dig up my graves. They always seem to come back, though I like it when they don't. Maybe this is one of those times.  

""Ugh,"" I groan as I get into my seat for another hour-long lunch period. What could they have dug up that would make them want to stay here with me? Nobody has ever stayed here long enough to really learn anything about this place though, which means the only thing they should be able to understand is how good the coffee smells. Sure enough, it hits them in the face with its aroma of roasting beans. ""This will ruin everything."" 

When did it become cool to leave your corpse out on display like this? It just became too modern a trend. I never had the luxury to be an earthbound man as I came straight to Hell. Now, there are more humans buried than any of our denizens of darkness deserve. The only ones they still haven't found yet are all still alive. 

Sure, they'll find me eventually. My human form isn't so impressive. People can see through it after only being born once...though for some reason no bodyguards have been sent here since I got pulled from that cage. Could someone have learned about these infernal dimensions too?  

Then again, most of humanity's knowledge doesn't even touch anything darker than 10th level necromancers: what could they possibly think I am? A lesser demon maybe? I doubt anyone but a few archangels dare venture down into hell and I know what they say goes if you do. Only the strongest or smartest beings dare step foot in the other realms, and none dare return unless someone drags them back by their damned souls. So why bother looking for me? 

Maybe I made a mistake when I said I was just going to visit him. That reminds me of my wife. If I wasn't stuck serving damnation here I wouldn't mind playing the part of Satan, I was better at it in life and it makes sense that he shouldn't have taken advantage. He was my soulmate, my equal, the god we were destined to rule over together and now that he went off to heaven she finds her freedom with me instead of him. I hate to say it but she's gone to the angels and she might join us before much longer. Oh well. We all have regrets.

One of these days I may even admit to myself whether she is worth the price. Until then this is where I remain: lonely and depressed. Fuck being trapped here forever. Where is that stupid magic shovel when I need it?

What's this, exactly?! Someone actually put a spade next to me! One hand has to be in order. Two hands? You know that phrase, right? Well guess what! Here comes the punchline, it looks like someone wants to give me a wake. At least that's what they must have been thinking because whoever dug me out here decided that laying waste with shovels isn't bad.  

Hey. How old is this guy anyway? Is he wearing clothes? Does his hair look familiar? Don't tell me. I swear, some of this stuff is just too obvious! Look, dude, if you don't mind me asking: does it matter that it looks like hell? Like I said above, nobody cares here and if you know any of these other dimensions you know that's bad news. Just put down the shovel quick and forget this didn't happen so you avoid any future troubles.

[removed]","**Answer:** To make sure the person there wasn't already dead...  

---- 
I guess you could say that humans don't have as much of an advantage over us when it comes to survival, and even though most people aren't as strong or fast as we are (it all depends on our level), it still would not be wise for us to go about running from everyone like werewolves just because they can smell us. And who knew if someone was already dead? That would be stupid; but I did wonder what would happen if a human touched me after I turned into one so to speak.  

After looking at the body in confusion I shook my head and walked away. There had been no signs of any sort of injury to the corpse. The skull looked fine! It didn't matter how far back this body went, there wasn't any sign of damage done in death and it seemed pretty normal to just walk off without a sound - which I did. I wasn't going to stand out in the moonlight and try to see what happened unless there was something wrong with either myself or the rest of my pack (or both). 


As I rounded the bend the other members were right outside the gate, waiting impatiently. The alpha, now slightly more hairy than he was a couple months ago, looked at me strangely ""Where do ya think those guys went?"" 


They might be talking about me for better or worse depending on their perspective, but we were friends before we started taking wolf bites every two years and eating brains whenever we turned.  ""They probably followed us.""

[removed]","My grandma lived in the small town of Elmwood, which had been dead for over 30 years now. She died before that and I never got to meet her, but she was so old when she ran away from home that all those folks who stayed behind just called her ""Grandma."" That's because it sounded more polite than a name like *Aggie.*

I drove by there on my way back from college one morning after being gone for four days. There wasn't any point in going back for anything. Everyone knew about what happened at the town hall meeting the previous week; our little pack of werewolves had shown our fangs and claws in public while eating the local politician. He hadn't noticed how well everyone else was armed. The mayor told everybody what they were doing to themselves would be tried in court. But we still went through with it anyway. Not sure why he still hasn't run for office again since then either. The guy is probably as lucky as me though that he didn't get eaten alive right in front of the others.

There isn't much to do in this boring town except work and go to church every Sunday. My parents worked construction jobs and paid off most of their debt before moving here six months ago. They did some renovations on the empty building up ahead of where you left us and started running their own business. Pretty impressive, considering your father used to only know about buildings as large as these two factories next door. They are still waiting for him to finish the foundation before starting work. It took them twenty-five minutes longer than expected to drive down this road each day for the first week. Thankfully the roads haven't frozen over yet, or they might have just ended up walking instead. Our boss said it wasn't wise for us to move out here anyway, especially without an active police force nearby. You have to understand, the last time someone actually asked me why I decided to come live here I almost choked. You should try doing it sometime. It tastes like acid rain and leaves in your throat. Just don't forget to tell them to bring water to drink afterwards!

The walk towards town was uneventful enough. If we hadn't seen the snow turning brown earlier today in high school gym class I would have brought out my car. The lights on your truck still burn brightly on this side of the highway though. We both look good in the light like that. You probably think it's creepy though. In truth, we both seem like monsters in this white sheet. I kind of liked the idea until Mrs. Johnson yelled at me about not covering myself properly before leaving. I know it sounds silly, but I always worried people would start treating me differently if the blood splattered everywhere. Apparently it doesn't matter very much if it happens to cover yourself, and even less if it splatters onto another person's clothes though. At least it doesn't feel cold and wet anymore under my sweater. Now that I've stopped crying tears of anguish at having to wear layers of clothing I can actually enjoy my mom knitting in her spare time. She picked up crocheting in high school because I wanted to use the school knitting club supplies for a project I was working on...and it turned into more than she could ever imagine. After school the other three girls in our group made the same craft decision: join the pottery club to learn how to make mug after mug after mug and mug of chocolate milk to sell at our bake sale during lunch duty. Then we got kicked out of our pottery class after it became obvious that we intended to leave mugs unbaked...which explains why half of our classmates broke up with their boyfriends and girlfriends throughout the year. Those things tend to stop when it becomes clear that the relationship will become impossible to sustain when all you do together is drink chocolate milks from ceramic mugs. At least this gives me something to do other than spend time by myself in your bedroom and try to convince our parents that they should move to a different state. No offense or anything. But we needed to make money to afford college, and I was going to graduate within five years. What else am I supposed to do if I don't have plans after graduation? Well now you might say ""become self employed"", but I figured we could keep using the credit card to pay our rent and buy food until we saved enough money to pay it back. Which I guess is what we're doing right now. Anyway, it must have taken ten million dollars of interest. How does anybody afford gas?

There was no one else around for miles in the forest where we were at.  The trees towered over us both, their limbs like bony fingers pushing down on my head making me squirm.

I turned my hand to the small pouch hanging from it. A half-empty bag of seeds made of strange white flesh spilled onto the ground while the remaining pouch sat inside of my palm.

That was all it said. Not even an “good luck” or “have a good day”, no explanations for her termination, just cold-hard dismissal.

“What?!” Hannah whispered in disbelief as her supervisor announced her firing to everyone who had been hanging onto every word in that meeting. The only person there knew why - Mrs. Williams, the owner of Ms. H&M's fashion store. She turned to Hannah with a confused look before turning her head back and asking others what they were doing looking like that. 

“Just… Just wait”, Hannah muttered to herself, as if some sort of time warp could be reversed. It wouldn’t! That was true now! She couldn’t go back and get this moment erased, no matter how many times she tried. If someone was mad enough to curse her she should have known better than to try to change destiny by attempting to undo the past, and yet here she sat wondering whether or not it really was possible.

She told me that she loved the position before leaving though and I really hope we can get another meeting sometime soon with something even slightly related to accounting since now everything that has been coming across my desk doesn't make sense without an understanding of business practices or financial reporting (which I know isn't something I excel at but I can learn).
