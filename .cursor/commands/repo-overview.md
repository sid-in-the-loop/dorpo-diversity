# repo-overview

I want a complete, top-to-bottom understanding of this repository. Assume it is a research-grade RL/ML training codebase. Provide a structured explanation covering:

Overall purpose of the repo and the main research ideas.

High-level architecture: modules, directories, and how components relate (environment, models, training loop, data pipeline, configs, scripts).

All training approaches and run types supported (e.g., PPO, GRPO, reward modeling, offline RL, ablations, baselines), including when each is used.

Execution pipeline from start to finish: config loading → data/env setup → model construction → training loop → logging → checkpoints → evaluation.

Function-call flow for the core loop: which functions call which, in what order, and why.

Key classes/functions with short summaries of their roles.

How experiments are launched (scripts, CLI, configs) and how results are logged/stored.

Any gotchas, assumptions, or non-standard design choices in the repo.
Be precise, avoid fluff, and explain the repo as if onboarding a new researcher who needs to extend it.

This command will be available in chat with /repo-overview
